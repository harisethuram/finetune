585,impresses as a skillfully assembled  highly polished and professional adaptation  just about as chilling and unsettling as  manhunter  was  
586,failure to construct a story with even a trace of dramatic interest 
587,but it also comes with the laziness and arrogance of a thing that already knows it s won

691,moody male hustler 
692,uselessly redundant and shamelessly moneygrubbing than most thirdrate horror sequels 
693,the film is filled with humorous observations about the general absurdity of modern life as seen through the eyes outsiders  but deftly manages to avoid many of the condescending stereotypes that so often plague films dealing with the mentally ill 
694,which is mostly a bore 
695,an entertaining mix of period drama and flatout farce that should please history fans 
696,suspect that you ll be as bored watching morvern callar as the characters are in it  
697,the problems and characters it reveals are universal and involving  and the film itself  as well its delightful cast  is so breezy  pretty and gifted  it really won my heart  
698,love this movie

707,a satisfyingly unsettling ride 
708,good a job as anyone 
709, smart and complicated 
710,the intimate  unguarded moments of folks who live in unusual homes  
711,are pretty valuable these days 
712, i  t s certainly laudable that the movie deals with hotbutton issues in a comedic context  but barbershop is nt as funny as it should be  
713,that the only rip off that we were aware of

737,colorful  vibrant introduction 
738,the slow parade of human frailty fascinates you 
739,famuyiwa s feature deals with its subject matter in a tasteful  intelligent manner  rather than forcing us to endure every plot contrivance that the clichériddled genre can offer  
740,a laugh between them 
741,that gradually sneaks up on the audience 
742,photographic marvel 
743,is shockingly bad and absolutely unnecessary  
744,gets vivid performances from her cast and pulls off some deft ally mcbealstyle fantasy sequences  
745,the result  however wellintentioned  is ironically just the sort of disposable  kitchensink homage that illustrates why the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts in today s hollywood  
746,while not for every taste  this often very funny collegiate grossout comedy goes a long way toward restoring the luster of the national lampoon film franchise  too long reduced to directtovideo irrelevancy  
747,wow  factor 
748,hashiguchi covers this territory with wit and originality  suggesting that with his fourth feature  the first to be released in the us  a major director is emerging in world cinema

759,been lost in the translation this time 
760,revelatory performance 
761,the pianist like a surgeon mends a broken heart  very meticulously but without any passion 
762,remains oddly detached 
763,that is more complex and honest than anything represented in a hollywood film 
764,nifty premise 
765,vein 
766,the wonderfully lush morvern callar is pure punk existentialism  and 
767,go down with a ship as leaky 
768,earnest movie

770,showing us wellthought stunts or a car chase that we have nt seen 10000 times 
771,make the film more silly than scary  like some sort of martha stewart decorating program run amok 
772,going at a rapid pace  
773,still fun and enjoyable and 
774,a lazy exercise in bad filmmaking 
775,this thing is virtually unwatchable  
776,s also undeniably exceedingly clever 
777,would ever work in a mcculloch production again if they looked at how this movie turned out

796,makes piecing the story together frustrating difficult 
797,a fascinating  compelling story 
798,the film s hero is a bore and his innocence soon becomes a questionable kind of inexcusable dumb innocence 
799,a fascinating  dark thriller that keeps you hooked on the delicious pulpiness of its lurid fiction

2168,an affection 
2169,love to come from an american director in years 
2170,most resonant film since the killer  
2171,works out 
2172,in the name of an allegedly inspiring and easily marketable flick  the emperor s club turns a blind eye to the very history it pretends to teach  
2173,the widowmaker is derivative  overlong  and bombastic  yet surprisingly entertaining  
2174, ash wednesday is essentially devoid of interesting characters or even a halfway intriguing plot  
2175,is great 
2176,spirit s visual imagination reminds you of why animation is such a perfect medium for children  because of the way it allows the mind to enter and accept another world  
2177,judging by those standards   scratch  is a pretty decent little documentary  
2178,engaging  surprisingly touching british comedy 
2179, energy and geniality to please not only the fanatical adherents on either side  but also people who know nothing about the subject and think they re not interested  
2180,confident filmmaking and a pair of fascinating performances 
2181,avoid the ghetto of sentimental chickflicks by treating female follies with a satirical style 
2182,in one scene  we get a stab at soccer hooliganism  a doublebarreled ripoff of quentin tarantino s climactic shootout  and meat loaf explodes  
2183,a sugarcoated rocky whose valuable messages are forgotten 10 minutes after the last trombone honks  
2184,death  especially 
2185,by the dynamic first act 
2186,fails so fundamentally on every conventional level 
2187,too daft by half  but supremely good natured  
2188,the worst sin of attributable to a movie like this 
2189,i have always appreciated a smartly written motion picture  and  whatever flaws igby goes down may possess  it is undeniably that  
2190,the film s plot may be shallow 
2191,rotten in almost every single facet of production that you ll want to crawl up your own  in embarrassment  
2192, epic 
2193,easy to like 
2194,steers  in his feature film debut  has created a brilliant motion picture  
2195,an inelegant combination of two unrelated shorts that falls far short of the director s previous work 
2196,it s rare to find a film to which the adjective  gentle  applies  
2197,a director beginning to resemble someone s crazy french grandfather 
2198, frailty  has been written so well  that even a simple  goddammit   
2199,are uncomfortably strained  
2200,make the film more silly than scary  
2201,what makes it worth watching 
2202,has one of the most moronic screenplays of the year  full of holes that will be obvious even to those who are nt looking for them  
2203,huge disappointment coming 
2204,deliver a riveting and surprisingly romantic ride 
2205,the rest of the cast comes across as stick figures reading lines from a teleprompter  
2206,that the typical hollywood disregard for historical truth and realism is at work here 
2207,you ca nt help but feel  stoked   
2208,wonderful  imaginative script 
2209,entirely witless 
2210,is akin to a reader s digest condensed version of the source material 
2211,fun or 
2212,ponderous to work as shallow entertainment  not remotely incisive enough to qualify as drama  monsoon 
2213,shows its indie tatters and selfconscious seams in places  
2214,unfolds with all the mounting tension of an expert thriller 
2215,a film that s rarely as entertaining as it could have been 
2216,obscenity 
2217,stitched together from stock situations and characters from other movies 
2218,can be viewed as pure composition and form  
2219,look at that clever angle  
2220,of the best films of the year with its exquisite acting  inventive screenplay  mesmerizing music  and many inimitable scenes 
2221,the surprisingly somber conclusion 
2222,not only learning but inventing a remarkable new trick  
2223,tepid 
2224,s something to be said for a studioproduced film that never bothers to hand viewers a suitcase full of easy answers  
2225,the lowgrade cheese standards on which it operates 
2226,give each other the willies 
2227, lee  treats his audience the same way that jim brown treats his women  as dumb  credulous  unassuming  subordinate subjects  
2228,is credible and remarkably mature 
2229,highlighted by a gritty style and an excellent cast  it s better than one might expect when you look at the list of movies starring icet in a major role  
2230,of the unsung heroes of 20th century 
2231,that s actually sort of amazing 
2232,that rare movie that works on any number of levels  as a film of magic and whimsy for children  a heartfelt romance for teenagers and a compelling argument about death  both pro and con  for adults 
2233,the young stars are too cute  the story and ensuing complications are too manipulative  the message is too blatant 
2234,a streetwise mclaughlin group 
2235,funny and wellcontructed 
2236,s mired in a shabby script that piles layer upon layer of action man cliché atop wooden dialogue and a shifting tone that falls far short of the peculiarly moral amorality of  woo s  best work 
2237,oversimplification  superficiality and silliness 
2238,overproduced 
2239,if it had been only halfanhour long or a tv special  the humor would have been fast and furious  at ninety minutes  it drags 
2240,though he only scratches the surface 
2241,awash in selfconsciously flashy camera effects  droning house music and flat  flat dialogue 
2242,visual splendor 
2243,lingering questions about what the film is really getting at 
2244,an  action film  mired in stasis 
2245,dragon 
2246,most intense 
2247,this is a visually stunning rumination on love  memory  history and the war between art and commerce  
2248,s about as convincing as any other arnie musclefest  but has a little too much resonance with real world events and ultimately comes off as insultingly simplistic  
2249,carried out by men of marginal intelligence  
2250,dialogue that cuts to the chase of the modern girl s dilemma 
2251,that the plot makes no sense 
2252,too bad none of it is funny  
2253,can seem tiresomely simpleminded  
2254,combines improbable melodrama  gored bullfighters  comatose ballerinas  with subtly kinky bedside vigils and sensational denouements  and yet at the end 
2255,twohy s a good yarnspinner  and ultimately the story compels 
2256,wellmeant 
2257,bad need of major acting lessons and maybe a little coffee 
2258,america s thirst for violence 
2259,so horrendously confusing 
2260,avarice 
2261,when you re a struggling nobody 
2262,talkiness 
2263, ballistic  ecks vs sever  seems as safe as a children s film  
2264,ignore the reputation  and ignore the film  
2265,manage to be spectacularly outrageous 
2266,cookiecutter action scenes 
2267,of the best since the last waltz 
2268,to lawrence s overindulgent tirade 
2269,a pale imitation 
2270,withered 
2271,pass for a thirteenyearold s book report 
2272,a windtunnel and a simply astounding corblimeyluvaduck cockney accent 
2273,writing  skewed characters  
2274,to provoke them 
2275,remarkable skill 
2276,is the stuff that disney movies are made of  
2277,enough sentimental 
2278,crawl up your own  
2279,there s not enough intelligence  wit or innovation on the screen to attract and sustain an older crowd  
2280,that sends you out of the theater feeling 
2281,a sundrenched masterpiece  part parlor game  part psychological case study 
2282,engaging comedy 
2283,certainly an entertaining ride  despite many talky  slow scenes 
2284,strong performances 
2285,is a smorgasbord of soliloquies about nothing delivered by the former mr drew barrymore  
2286,folds under its own thinness  
2287,itself virtually collapses into an inhalant blackout  maintaining consciousness just long enough to achieve callow pretension 
2288,conceptual feat 
2289, sitting through dahmer s two hours amounts to little more than punishment  
2290,genuine rather than pandering 
2291,randolph 
2292,great to knock back a beer with but they re simply not funny performers 
2293,did i miss something  
2294,a porno flick 
2295,this is a gorgeous film  vivid with color  music and life  
2296,simply by accident 
2297,nothing special 
2298,never bothers to question why somebody might devote time to see it 
2299,this movie s lack of ideas 
2300,cynicism 
2301,take an entirely stale concept and 
2302, wit and interesting characters 
2303,is an alltime low for kevin costner 
2304,a stylish but steady  and ultimately very satisfying  piece of characterdriven storytelling 
2305,it is an interesting exercise by talented writerdirector anderson 
2306,surprising flair 
2307,i liked it just enough  
2308,an uneasy mix of runofthemill raunchy humor and seemingly sincere personal reflection  
2309,a grand fart coming from a director beginning to resemble someone s crazy french grandfather  
2310,some of the backstory is a little tired 
2311,nothing of the audience other than to sit back and enjoy a couple of great actors hamming it up 
2312,huppert  is magnificent 
2313,puzzle whose pieces do not fit 
2314,sorority boys  which is as bad at it is cruel  
2315, and long  for its own good 
2316,of empty  fetishistic violence in which murder is casual and fun 
2317,intrigue 
2318,its characters  decisions only unsatisfactorily 
2319,is a powerful  naturally dramatic piece of lowbudget filmmaking  
2320,perhaps it s cliche to call the film  refreshing 
2321,kidempowerment 
2322,a fascinating  unnerving examination 
2323,could as easily have been called  under siege 3  in alcatraz   a cinematic corpse that never springs to life  
2324,odoriferous thing 
2325,brilliantly written and wellacted 
2326,to gravity and plummets 
2327,it s a smart  funny look at an arcane area of popular culture  and 
2328,joy 
2329,is wickedly fun to watch 
2330,the imagined glory of their own pasts 
2331,deft 
2332,a lowbudget affair  tadpole was shot on digital video  and the images often look smeary and blurry  to the point of distraction  
2333,does nt have a passion for the material  
2334,but that they are doing it is thoughtprovoking  
2335,a climax 
2336, scarily funny  sorrowfully sympathetic to the damage it surveys 
2337,neil burger s impressive fake documentary 
2338,in looking at the comic effects of jealousy 
2339,is tenderly observant of his characters  
2340,its dark  delicate treatment 
2341,has no idea of it is serious 
2342,brutal and 
2343,he s just a sad aristocrat in tattered finery  
2344,it s excessively quirky and a little underconfident in its delivery  but otherwise this is the best  old neighborhood  project since christopher walken kinda romanced cyndi lauper in the opportunists  
2345,classify as it is hard to resist 
2346, undisputed scores a direct hit  
2347,of menacing atmosphere 
2348,painful  horrifying and oppressively tragic 
2349,perfect for the proud warrior that still lingers in the souls of these characters 
2350,in luminous interviews and amazingly evocative film from three decades ago 
2351,usual bumbling  tonguetied screen persona 
2352,easy jokes and insults 
2353,quitting  however  manages just to be depressing  as the lead actor phones in his autobiographical performance  
2354,a sincerely crafted picture 
2355,what might have been readily dismissed as the tiresome rant of an aging filmmaker still thumbing his nose at convention takes a surprising  subtle turn at the midway point  
2356,long gone 
2357,the movie is remarkably dull with only caine making much of an impression  
2358,is a visually stunning rumination on love  memory  history and the war between art and commerce 
2359,an excuse to get to the closing bout  by which time it s impossible to care who wins 
2360,by a script that takes few chances and manages to insult the intelligence of everyone in the audience 
2361,about how good it all was  and started doing nothing but reacting to it  feeling a part of its grand locations  thinking urgently as the protagonists struggled  feeling at the mercy of its inventiveness  gasping at its visual delights 
2362,soderbergh  like kubrick before him  may not touch the planet s skin  but understands the workings of its spirit  
2363,spontaneity in its execution 
2364,feels as immediate as the latest news footage from gaza and  because of its heightened  wellshaped dramas  twice as powerful  
2365,spiderman rocks 
2366,lowbrow humor  gratuitous violence and 
2367,was nt one of the film s virtues  
2368,style adventure that plays like a bad soap opera  with passable performances from everyone in the cast 
2369,stirs us as well  
2370,a nonbritney person might survive a screening with little harm done  except maybe for the last 15 minutes  which are as maudlin as any afterschool special you can imagine  
2371,your 20th outing shows off a lot of stamina and vitality  and get this  madonna s cameo does nt suck  
2372,an uneven film for the most part 
2373, the movie sinks into an abyss of clichés  depression and bad alternative music  
2374,miracles 
2375,his storytelling skills have eroded 
2376, shakes the clown   a much funnier film with a similar theme 
2377, others will find their humorseeking dollars best spent elsewhere  
2378,the film is just a corny examination of a young actress trying to find her way  
2379, madonna is one helluva singer  
2380,hoary dialogue  fluxing accents  and 
2381,will probably find it fascinating 
2382,good ear 
2383,undistinguished rhythm 
2384,have no idea what in creation is going on 
2385,fascinating but flawed look 
2386,spend years trying to comprehend it 
2387,is both a snore and utter tripe 
2388,to treat its characters  weak and strong  as fallible human beings  not caricatures  and 
2389,though it goes further than both  anyone who has seen the hunger or cat people will find little new here  but a tasty performance from vincent gallo lifts this tale of cannibal lust above the ordinary  
2390,the gloss 
2391,we hate  madonna  within the film s first five minutes  and she lacks the skill or presence to regain any ground 
2392,bitter italian comedy 
2393,banal dialogue 
2394,of the smarter offerings the horror genre 
2395,it rarely stoops to cheap manipulation or corny conventions to do it 
2396,optimism 
2397,but in terms of its style  the movie is in a class by itself 
2398,as a tarantula  helga 
2399,like a highend john hughes comedy  a kind of elder bueller s time out 
2400,been quashed by whatever obscenity is at hand 
2401,wannabe comedy 
2402,afraid to provoke introspection in both its characters and its audience 
2403,the better videogamebased flicks  
2404,little action  almost no suspense or believable tension 
2405,blasphemous bad 
2406,woozy quality 
2407,nothing interesting in unfaithful 
2408,sheds light 
2409,work as well as a remarkably faithful one 
2410,want to watch if you only had a week to live 
2411,onedimensional buffoons 
2412,without a conclusion or pay off 
2413,is a tired one 
2414,we ve seen the hippieturnedyuppie plot before 
2415,if a big musical number like  praise the lord  he s the god of second chances  does nt put you off 
2416,terror by suggestion  rather than the overuse of special effects 
2417,patient and tenacious 
2418,the most horrific movie experience i ve had since  ca nt stop the music   
2419,too obviously 
2420,watch on video at home 
2421,the movie is loaded with good intentions 
2422,for occasional smiles 
2423,of all ages 
2424,bland  surfacey way 
2425,this nicholas nickleby finds itself in reduced circumstances  and 
2426,it s fitting that a movie as artificial and soulless as the country bears owes its genesis to an animatronic display at disneyland  
2427,begins with the everyday lives of naval personnel in san diego and ends with scenes so true and heartbreaking that tears welled up in my eyes both times i 
2428,s fitting that a movie as artificial and soulless as the country bears owes its genesis to an animatronic display at disneyland 
2429,leave it to john sayles to take on developers  the chamber of commerce  tourism  historical pageants  and commercialism all in the same movie  without neglecting character development for even one minute 
2430,frightening war scenes 
2431,tremendous piece 
2432,must have been astronomically bad 
2433,the movie s fragmentary narrative style makes piecing the story together frustrating difficult 
2434,goes by quickly 
2435,and that makes all the difference  
2436,the filmmakers found this a remarkable and novel concept 
2437,at three hours and with very little story or character development  there is plenty of room for editing  and a much shorter cut surely would have resulted in a smoother  more focused narrative without sacrificing any of the cultural intrigue  
2438,spotty 
2439,amid the new populist comedies that underscore the importance of family tradition and familial community  one would be hardpressed to find a movie with a bigger  fatter heart than barbershop  
2440,while the performances are often engaging 
2441,you ve seen a movie instead of an endless trailer 
2442,solid filmmaking 
2443,his outstanding performance 
2444,s super  violent  superserious and superstupid  
2445,a gorgeously strange movie  heaven is deeply concerned with morality  but it refuses to spell things out for viewers 
2446,perfect example 
2447,elaborate futuristic sets to no particularly memorable effect 
2448,than an autopsy  the movie 
2449,exploitative and 
2450,offering fine acting moments and 
2451,a wacky  screwball comedy 
2452,solid  satisfying fare 
2453, a nice  harmless date film 
2454,overall  it s a very entertaining  thoughtprovoking film with a simple message  god is love  
2455,of 2day old coke 
2456,combines the enigmatic features of  memento  
2457,have all but ruined his career 
2458,worldlywise and very funny 
2459,has you study them 
2460,get for a buck or so in that greasy little vidgame pit in the theater lobby 
2461,is nt just offensive 
2462,pop up in nearly every corner of the country 
2463,worth yet another visit 
2464,friendly 
2465,a deadly bore 
2466,would go back and choose to skip it 
2467,bravery 
2468,an energetic and engaging film that never pretends to be something it is nt  
2469,too many clever things 
2470,a festival film that would have been better off staying on the festival circuit 
2471,come from seeing former nymphette juliette lewis playing a saltoftheearth mommy named minnie and watching slim travel incognito in a ridiculous wig no respectable halloween costume shop would ever try to sell  
2472,allowing us to find the small  human moments  
2473,desert 
2474,spontaneous creativity and authentic cooperative interaction 
2475,miyazaki has created such a vibrant  colorful world  it s almost impossible not to be swept away by the sheer beauty of his images  
2476,a wellwritten and occasionally challenging social drama 
2477,as a thoughtful and unflinching examination of an alternative lifestyle 
2478,to be liberating 
2479,the movie wavers between hallmark card sentimentality and goofy  lifeaffirming moments straight out of a cellular phone commercial  
2480,gorgeous color palette 
2481,starting with spielberg and going right through the ranks of the players  oncamera and off  that he brings together 
2482, ballistic  ecks vs sever also features terrible  banal dialogue  convenient  holeridden plotting  superficial characters and a rather dull  unimaginative car chase  
2483,an older cad instructs a younger lad in zen and the art of getting laid in this prickly indie comedy of manners and misanthropy  
2484,a mostly believable  refreshingly lowkey and quietly inspirational little sports 
2485, still manages at least a decent attempt at meaningful cinema 
2486, but i believe a movie can be mindless without being the peak of all things insipid 
2487,for the rest of us  sitting through dahmer s two hours amounts to little more than punishment  
2488,gaunt  silverhaired and leonine   harris  brings a tragic dimension and savage fullbodied wit and cunning to the aging sandeman  
2489,distorts reality for people who make movies and watch them 
2490,luridly graphic and 
2491, clumsily staged violence overshadows everything  including most of the actors  
2492,that should be thrown back in the river 
2493,drab 
2494,is almost 
2495,mike white s deft combination of serious subject matter and dark  funny humor make  the good girl  a film worth watching  
2496,still fun and enjoyable and so aggressively silly 
2497,display an original talent 
2498,but mostly it s a work that  with humor  warmth  and intelligence  captures a life interestingly lived  
2499,there might be some sort of credible genderprovoking philosophy submerged here  but who the hell cares  
2500,good action  good acting  good dialogue  good pace  good cinematography 
2501,moments and an intelligent subtlety 
2502,to the brim with ideas 
2503,surrounded by 86 minutes of overlyfamiliar and poorlyconstructed comedy 
2504,its sensitive handling of some delicate subject matter 
2505,impressive talent 
2506,the chills 
2507,full of surprises 
2508,you sweat 
2509,i could nt help but feel the wasted potential of this slapstick comedy  
2510,with tiny little jokes and nary an original idea 
2511,is still quite goodnatured and 
2512,rich in color and creativity 
2513,found its audience

2528,going to face frightening late fees 
2529,is its surreal sense of humor and technological finish  
2530,is so engagingly 
2531,of day by concentrating on the elements of a revealing alienation among a culture of people who sadly are at hostile odds with one another through recklessness and retaliation 
2532,that is as difficult for the audience to take as it 
2533,putrid it is not worth the price of the match that should be used to burn every print of the film  
2534,a ripoff 
2535,an obvious copy

2834,bighearted 
2835,the film has an infectious enthusiasm and we re touched by the film s conviction that all life centered on that place  that time and that sport 
2836,the film never feels draggy 
2837,it is dark  brooding and slow  and takes its central idea way too seriously  
2838,salvos hitting a discernible target

2845,as much as i laughed throughout the movie  i can not mount a cogent defense of the film as entertainment  or even performance art  although the movie does leave you marveling at these guys  superhuman capacity to withstand pain  
2846,what s with all the shooting 
2847,of  ethnic cleansing 
2848,without neglecting character development for even one minute

2879,a searing lead performance 
2880,menacing atmosphere 
2881,though intrepid in exploring an attraction that crosses sexual identity  ozpetek falls short in showing us antonia s true emotions  but 
2882,are many definitions of  time waster  
2883,hours of material to discuss 
2884,one scene after another in this supposedly funny movie falls to the floor with a sickening thud  
2885,that old adage about women being unknowable gets an exhilarating new interpretation in morvern callar  
2886,luminous interviews 
2887,the script s refusal of a happy ending 
2888,alternating with lots of sloppiness 
2889,gets old quickly 
2890,of the obvious cliches 
2891,not only does the thoroughly formulaic film represent totally exemplify middleoftheroad mainstream  it also represents glossy hollywood at its laziest  
2892,after the phoniness of femalebonding pictures like divine secrets of the yaya sisterhood 
2893,leaves little doubt that kidman has become one of our best actors 
2894,using them as punching bags 
2895,tykwer s surface flash is nt just a poor fit with kieslowski s lyrical pessimism 
2896,exhausted  desiccated talent 
2897,the laziness and arrogance 
2898,lowtech magic realism 
2899, spiderman is better than any summer blockbuster we had to endure last summer  and hopefully  sets the tone for a summer of good stuff  
2900,this delightful comedy 
2901,vapid 
2902,a worthwhile effort 
2903,a pathetic exploitation film that tries to seem sincere  and just seems worse for the effort  
2904,by a central plot that s peppered with false starts and populated by characters who are nearly impossible to care about 
2905,extraordinary access 
2906,so intimate and sensual and funny and psychologically selfrevealing 
2907,highly engaging  
2908,wisdom and emotion 
2909,fascinating  unnerving examination 
2910,watching this film  one is left with the inescapable conclusion that hitchens  obsession with kissinger is  at bottom  a sophisticated flower child s desire to purge the world of the tooth and claw of human power  
2911,you were at home watching that movie instead of in the theater watching this one 
2912,about 90 minutes of a socalled  comedy  and not laugh 
2913,arrive early and stay late  filling nearly every minute  with a lighthearted glow  some impudent snickers  and a glorious dose of humankind s liberating ability to triumph over a scrooge or two 
2914,affection for its characters 
2915,mixes in as much humor as pathos 
2916,a complete moron 
2917,abandon spends 90 minutes trying figure out whether or not some cocky pseudointellectual kid has intentionally left college or was killed  
2918,few nice twists 
2919,a moving story 
2920,a bunch of typical latetwentysomethings natter on about nothing 
2921,not only better than its predecessor 
2922,funny and  in the end  very touching 
2923,too skewed to ever get a hold on 
2924,thriller as lazy as it is interminable 
2925,s a shame the marvelous first 101 minutes have to be combined with the misconceived final 5  
2926,a funny  puzzling movie 
2927, i enjoyed it just as much  
2928,stooping 
2929,with a completely predictable plot 
2930,solid base 
2931,by bad luck and their own immaturity 
2932,to a strangely sinister happy ending 
2933,had the balance shifted in favor of waterbound action over the landbased  drama 
2934,so we got ten little indians meets friday the 13th by way of clean and sober  filmed on the set of carpenter s the thing and loaded with actors you re most likely to find on the next inevitable incarnation of the love boat  
2935, pathetic  starving and untalented 
2936,the problem with antwone fisher is that it has a screenplay written by antwone fisher based on the book by antwone fisher  
2937,has merit and 
2938, with really solid performances by ving rhames and wesley snipes  
2939,both the elements of the plot and a powerfully evocative mood combining heated sexuality with a haunting sense of malaise 
2940,not that any of us 
2941,astonish and entertain 
2942,play well in european markets  where mr besson is a brand name  and in asia  where ms shu is an institution 
2943,a film that proposes as epic tragedy the plight of a callow rich boy who is forced to choose between his beautiful  selfsatisfied 22yearold girlfriend and an equally beautiful  selfsatisfied 18yearold mistress 
2944,be exploring the idea of why human beings long for what they do nt have  and how this gets us in trouble 
2945,having been slimed in the name of high art 
2946,shooting itself 
2947, sterile and lacking 
2948,elicit more of a sense of deja vu than awe 
2949,been worth cheering as a breakthrough 
2950,all credibility flies out the window  
2951,corny television 
2952,fights the good fight in vietnam 
2953,engaging the audience in the travails of creating a screenplay 
2954,rustic  realistic  and altogether creepy 
2955,things really get weird  though not particularly scary  
2956,hughes comedy 
2957,the disjointed 
2958,assumes you are nt very bright 
2959,is a genuine love story  full of traditional layers of awakening and ripening and separation and recovery  
2960,s not entirely memorable 
2961,heavyhanded symbolism  dimestore psychology and endless scenic shots that make 105 minutes seem twice as long 
2962,nothing left to work with  sort of like michael jackson s nose 
2963,daring and beautifully made 
2964, you may be surprised at the variety of tones in spielberg s work  
2965,works against itself 
2966,i hated myself in the morning  
2967,with efficiency and an affection for the period 
2968,confection that s pure entertainment 
2969,bearing the unmistakable stamp of authority 
2970,the intentionally low standards of fratboy humor 
2971,is impressive 
2972,if cinema had been around to capture the chaos of france in the 1790 s  one imagines the result would look like something like this  
2973, it is visually ravishing  penetrating  impenetrable  
2974,of the jokes  most at women s expense 
2975,fascination  and 
2976,amazing slapstick 
2977,low  very low  
2978,weightless that a decent draft in the auditorium might blow it off the screen 
2979,leaves vague impressions and a nasty aftertaste but little clear memory of its operational mechanics 
2980,told through oncamera interviews with several survivors  whose riveting memories are rendered with such clarity that it s as if it all happened only yesterday 
2981,those who do will have found a cult favorite to enjoy for a lifetime  
2982,undone by anachronistic quick edits and occasional jarring glimpses of a modern theater audience watching the events unfold 
2983,starts to smack of a hallmark hall of fame  with a few four letter words thrown in that are generally not heard on television 
2984,is even worse 
2985,the inspiration of the original 
2986,if oscar had a category called best bad film you thought was going to be really awful but was nt 
2987,fine idea 
2988,mawkish 
2989,payne has created a beautiful canvas  and nicholson proves once again that he s the best brush in the business  
2990,the most restless young audience deserves the dignity of an action hero motivated by something more than franchise possibilities  
2991,so stupid 
2992,a good chance of being the big 
2993,wise enough to recognize that there are few things in this world more complex  and  as it turns out  more fragile  than happiness 
2994,it s a masterpeice  
2995,a sour taste 
2996, much better  
2997,but on the whole  you re gon na like this movie  
2998,a central plot that s peppered with false starts and populated by characters who are nearly impossible to care about 
2999,the picture provides a satisfyingly unsettling ride into the dark places of our national psyche  
3000,buy is an accomplished actress  and this is a big  juicy role 
3001,are too simplistic to maintain interest 
3002,most wondrously gifted artists 
3003,rushed

3262,smaller numbered kidlets will enjoy  
3263,the movie s biggest shocks come from seeing former nymphette juliette lewis playing a saltoftheearth mommy named minnie and watching slim travel incognito in a ridiculous wig no respectable halloween costume shop would ever try to sell

3281,agreed 
3282,to keep you at the edge of your seat with its shapeshifting perils  political intrigue and brushes with calamity 
3283,is matched only by the ridiculousness of its premise 
3284,including that between the son and his wife  and the wife and the father  and between the two brothers  with incredible subtlety and acumen 
3285,he has actually bothered to construct a real story this time

3287,paul cox needed to show it  
3288,skip this dreck 
3289,marginal intelligence 
3290,delightfully so 
3291,that martin lawrence s latest vehicle can explode obnoxiously into 2500 screens while something of bubba hotep s clearly evident quality may end up languishing on a shelf somewhere 
3292,nearly all the fundamentals you take for granted in most films are mishandled here  
3293,nevertheless  it still seems endless  
3294,a few laughs

3299,zips along with bmovie verve while adding the rich details and goforbroke acting that heralds something special  
3300,is that i ca nt wait to see what the director does next  
3301,with so much firstrate talent 
3302,in welcome perspective 
3303,seems based on ugly ideas instead of ugly behavior  as happiness was  
3304,thanks to confident filmmaking and a pair of fascinating performances 
3305,the visuals  even erotically frank ones  
3306,meeting  even exceeding expectations  it s the best sequel since the empire strikes back  a majestic achievement  an epic of astonishing grandeur and surprising emotional depth  
3307,believe that resident evil is not it  
3308,the story has its redundancies  and the young actors  not very experienced  are sometimes inexpressive 
3309,mctiernan s remake may be lighter on its feet  the soberminded original was as graceful as a tapdancing rhino  but it is just as boring and as obvious 
3310,the film starts promisingly  but the ending is all too predictable and far too cliched to really work 
3311,upbeat ending 
3312,pokemon 4ever 
3313,for granted in most films are mishandled here 
3314,smug grin

3318, moving  and adventurous directorial debut 
3319,skillfully assembled  
3320,the direction occasionally rises to the level of marginal competence  but for most of the film it is hard to tell who is chasing who or why 
3321,samuel l jackson is one of the best actors there is  
3322,treasure planet rivals the top japanese animations of recent vintage  
3323,grabs you 
3324,may lack the pungent bite of its title  but 
3325,to pass this stinker off as a scary movie 
3326,sustain interest to the end 
3327,should come with the warning  for serious film buffs only   
3328,own ambitious goals 
3329,that s enough to sustain laughs 
3330,a solid cast  assured direction and complete lack of modern day irony 
3331,in hero worship 
3332,feel compelled to watch the film twice or pick up a book on the subject 
3333,unexpected flashes of dark comedy

3342,repeated at least four times 
3343,a determined  ennuihobbled slog that really does nt have much to say beyond the news 
3344,is it really an advantage to invest such subtlety and warmth in an animatronic bear when the humans are acting like puppets  
3345,s about individual moments of mood  and an aimlessness that s actually sort of amazing  
3346,futile 
3347,month 
3348, as if the director is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as very important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a hollywood product 
3349,wonderfully loopy tale of love  longing  and voting 
3350,collapses under its own meager weight  
3351,a satisfying wellmade romantic comedy that s both charming and well acted 
3352,flat  unconvincing 
3353,the film settles in and becomes compulsively watchable in a guiltypleasure  daytimedrama sort of fashion  
3354,it may be a somewhat backhanded compliment to say that the film makes the viewer feel like the movie s various victimized audience members after a while  but it also happens to be the movie s most admirable quality 
3355,love the opening scenes of a wintry new york city in 1899  
3356,unusual homes 
3357, beautifully realized 
3358,the misery 
3359,s simply stupid  irrelevant and deeply  truly 
3360,is this so boring 
3361,such a sophisticated and unsentimental treatment on the big screen 
3362,with heavyhanded symbolism  dimestore psychology and endless scenic shots that make 105 minutes seem twice as long 
3363,s rarely as entertaining as it could have been 
3364,pretty good little movie 
3365,that places the goodtime shenanigans in welcome perspective 
3366,that the movie has no idea of it is serious or 
3367,the creative animation work may not look as fully  rendered  as pixar s industry standard  but it uses lighting effects and innovative backgrounds to an equally impressive degree  
3368,willingness to wander into the dark areas of parentchild relationships without flinching 
3369,here a more annoying  though less angry 
3370,hard to pity the  plain  girl who becomes a ravishing waif after applying a smear of lipgloss 
3371, as well as rank frustration from those in the know about rubbo s dumbeddown tactics  
3372,warped logic 
3373,s so devoid of joy and energy it makes even jason x  look positively shakesperean by comparison  
3374,the film seem like something to endure instead of enjoy 
3375,about death 
3376,often silly  and gross  but it s rarely as moronic as some campus grossout films  
3377,push it through the audience s meat grinder one more time 
3378,bertrand tavernier s oftbrilliant safe conduct   laissezpasser   wears its heart on its sleeve 
3379,this is standard crime drama fare  instantly forgettable and thoroughly dull  
3380,the best of hollywood s comicbook 
3381, brilliant and macabre 
3382,bitter nor sweet 
3383,gaghan captures the halflit  sometimes creepy intimacy of college dorm rooms  a subtlety that makes the silly  overthetop coda especially disappointing  
3384,what with all the blanket statements and dimestore ruminations on vanity  the worries of the rich and sudden wisdom  the film becomes a sermon for most of its running time  
3385,a canny crowd pleaser  and the last kiss  provides more than enough sentimental catharsis for a satisfying evening at the multiplex 
3386,the film s saving graces 
3387,irreparably 
3388,is a riveting  brisk delight

3395,some real vitality and even art 
3396,dumb fart 
3397,how many more times will indie filmmakers subject us to boring  selfimportant stories of how horrible we are to ourselves and each other  
3398,logical  unforced continuation 
3399,contrived  awkward 
3400,that will give you goosebumps as its uncanny tale of love  communal discord  and justice 
3401,a lot smarter and more unnerving than the sequels 
3402,is among wiseman s warmest  
3403,that you ve seen it all before  even if you ve never come within a mile of the longest yard 
3404,s like rocky and bullwinkle on speed

3412,the quality that keeps dickens evergreen  the exuberant openness with which he expresses our most basic emotions 
3413,a fairy tale that comes from a renowned indian film culture that allows americans to finally revel in its splendor 
3414, the visuals and enveloping sounds of blue crush make this surprisingly decent flick worth a summertime looksee  
3415,however  it s pleasant enough and its ecological  prowildlife sentiments are certainly welcome  
3416,could have used my two hours better watching being john malkovich again 
3417,too much norma rae 
3418,technically sumptuous but also almost wildly alive 
3419,the best the contest received 
3420,suffers from all the excesses 
3421,is a seriously intended movie that is not easily forgotten  
3422, it s painful to watch witherspoon s talents wasting away inside unnecessary films like legally blonde and sweet home abomination  i mean  alabama   
3423,is the chance it affords to watch jackson  who also served as executive producer  take his smooth  shrewd  powerful act abroad  
3424,seen as hip  winking social commentary 
3425,rare family movie 
3426,no laughs  
3427,little less blingbling and a lot more 
3428,his machismo 
3429,played game of absurd plot twists  idiotic court maneuvers and stupid characters that even freeman ca nt save it 
3430,the characters  cast in impossibly contrived situations  are totally estranged from reality  
3431,in alcatraz   a cinematic corpse that never springs to life 
3432,the uninspired scripts  acting and direction never rise above the level of an afterschool tv special 
3433,beautiful work 
3434,sane and breathtakingly creative film 
3435,wonder 
3436,i encourage young and old alike to go see this unique and entertaining twist on the classic whale s tale  
3437,hide new secretions 
3438,s a clarity of purpose and evenhandedness 
3439,a pathetically 
3440,dullwitted and disquietingly creepy 
3441,a consummate actor incapable of being boring 
3442,becomes too heavy for the plot 
3443,with an assurance worthy of international acclaim 
3444,the delicious pulpiness of its lurid fiction 
3445,all the pieces fall together without much surprise  but little moments give it a boost 
3446,traveled to places in the world devastated by war  famine and poverty and documented the cruelty and suffering he has found with an devastating  eloquent clarity 
3447,gratingly unfunny 
3448,in narcissism and selfcongratulation disguised as a tribute 
3449,has a solid emotional impact  
3450,troubled and 
3451,sketchiest 
3452,holm does his sly  intricate magic  
3453,britney spears has popped up with more mindless drivel 
3454,emerges from the simple fact that the movie has virtually nothing to show  
3455,a love story and a murder mystery that expands into a meditation on the deep deceptions of innocence 
3456,will find millions of eager fans  
3457,wildly incompetent but brilliantly named half past dead  or for seagal pessimists  totally past his prime  
3458,presence to become a majorleague leading lady   but  
3459,for some major alterations 
3460,is so convinced of its own brilliance that  if it were a person  you d want to smash its face in 
3461,relatively dry 
3462, a series of tales told with the intricate preciseness of the best short story writing  
3463,too easy 
3464,of these tragic deaths 
3465,is actually dying a slow death  if the poor quality of pokemon 4 ever is any indication 
3466,bump in the night and nobody cares 
3467,perhaps it s cliche to call the film  refreshing   but 
3468,is the kind of movie where the big scene is a man shot out of a cannon into a vat of ice cream 
3469,falls to the floor with a sickening thud 
3470,s little to recommend snow dogs 
3471,the sick character 
3472,sentimental mess 
3473,that the movie does not do them justice 
3474,its story 
3475,astonishing   frames  profound ethical and philosophical questions in the form of dazzling pop entertainment 
3476,exudes the urbane sweetness 
3477,this starts off with a 1950 s doris day feel and it gets very ugly  very fast  
3478,a sensitive  cultivated treatment of greene s work as well as a remarkably faithful one  
3479,take me back to a time 
3480,induces headaches 
3481,takes an astonishingly condescending attitude toward women 
3482,like the logical  unforced continuation of the careers of a pair of spy kids 
3483,julie taymor s preposterous titus 
3484,be awed by the power and grace of one of the greatest natural sportsmen of modern times 
3485,ultimately undo him 
3486,you turn stupid 
3487,humorous observations about the general absurdity of modern life 
3488,delightfully unpredictable  hilarious 
3489,a computergenerated cold fish 
3490, one hour photo lives down to its title  
3491,worldlywise and very funny script 
3492,as a fairly weak retooling 
3493,polished and vastly entertaining 
3494,resents having to inhale this gutter romancer s secondhand material 
3495,simply stupid  irrelevant and deeply 
3496,satisfyingly unsettling ride 
3497,the past year  which means that birthday girl is the kind of quirkily appealing minor movie she might not make for a while 
3498,search of purpose or even a plot 
3499,an oddly winning portrayal of one of life s ultimate losers 
3500,terrible 
3501,mib ii is a movie that makes it possible for the viewer to doze off for a few minutes or make several runs to the concession stand andor restroom and not feel as if he or she has missed anything  
3502,s sharply comic and surprisingly touching  so hold the gong 
3503,the best espionage picture 
3504,lan yu never catches dramatic fire  
3505,tens of thousands of german jewish refugees 
3506,some startling  surrealistic moments 
3507,annoying rather than charming 
3508,is one of those reputedly  unfilmable  novels that has bucked the odds to emerge as an exquisite motion picture in its own right  
3509,impeccable comic timing 
3510,do well to cram earplugs in their ears and 
3511,is paced at a speed that is slow to those of us in middle age and deathly slow to any teen 
3512,takes a stand in favor of tradition and warmth 
3513,lacks the spirit of the previous two  and makes all those jokes about hos and even more unmentionable subjects seem like mere splashing around in the muck 
3514,for its excellent storytelling  its economical 
3515,is generous and deep 
3516,failed 
3517,most of what passes for sex in the movies look like cheap hysterics 
3518,it s an experience in understanding a unique culture that is presented with universal appeal  
3519,the compassion  goodnatured humor and the level of insight that made  eyre s  first film something of a sleeper success 
3520,the year s  unintentionally  funniest moments 
3521,superbly 
3522,french comingofage import 
3523,capable of anteing up some movie star charisma 
3524,a cute alien creature who mimics everyone and everything around 
3525,sad but 
3526,esteemed 
3527,the story is  forgive me  a little thin  and the filmmaking clumsy and rushed  
3528,problematic quest 
3529,substantial or fresh 
3530,watchable by a bravura performance 
3531,labute s careful handling makes the material seem genuine rather than pandering  
3532,misdemeanor 
3533, has solid acting and a neat premise 
3534,is infectious 
3535,it cooks conduct in a low  smoky and inviting sizzle  
3536,i must report that the children of varying ages in my audience never coughed  fidgeted or romped up and down the aisles for bathroom breaks  
3537,sad schlock merchant 
3538,its poignancy hooks us completely 
3539,less blingbling 
3540,slickly staged 
3541,sluggish pace and lack 
3542,relies on subtle ironies and visual devices 
3543,exaggerated action 
3544,are pitted against shimmering cinematography that lends the setting the ethereal beauty of an asian landscape painting 
3545,a movie to forget 
3546,s fun  
3547,the central flaw of the film 
3548,s too loud 
3549,wallowing in its characters  frustrations 
3550,the men and machines behind the curtains of our planet 
3551,a woefully dull  redundant concept that bears more than a whiff of exploitation  despite iwai s vaunted empathy 
3552,makes the journey feel like a party 
3553,a spoof comedy that carries its share of laughs  sometimes a chuckle  sometimes a guffaw and  to my great pleasure  the occasional belly laugh  
3554,truly  truly bad 
3555,on  well  love in the time of money 
3556,the story s scope and pageantry 
3557,uses the damage of war  far more often than the warfare itself  to create the kind of art shots that fill gallery shows 
3558,a quaint  romanticized rendering 
3559,be glued to the screen 
3560,warmth and 
3561,the plot has a number of holes  
3562,a thriller without thrills and a mystery devoid 
3563,oliver stone s conspiracy thriller jfk 
3564,clever  amusing and unpredictable 
3565,none of this sounds promising and  indeed  the first half of sorority boys is as appalling as any  comedy  to ever spill from a projector s lens 
3566,rambling incoherence 
3567,has dressed up this little parable in a fairly irresistible package full of privileged moments and memorable performances 
3568, intelligent eyes 
3569,scruffy  dopey old hannabarbera charm 
3570,france s most inventive directors 
3571,the ideal outlet 
3572,were convinced to waste their time 
3573,s an adventure story and history lesson all in one  
3574,created a masterful work of art of their own 
3575,linklater 
3576, green is  the comedy equivalent of saddam hussein  and i m just about ready to go to the un and ask permission for a preemptive strike  
3577,no   
3578,just about the best straightup  oldschool horror film of the last 15 years  
3579,bad  is the operative word for  bad company 
3580, you still have to see this  
3581,it stars schticky chris rock and stolid anthony hopkins  who seem barely in the same movie  
3582,proves a servicable world war ii drama that ca nt totally hide its contrivances  but it at least calls attention to a problem hollywood too long has ignored  
3583,get a cinematic postcard that s superficial and unrealized 
3584,display greatness 
3585,it is about irrational  unexplainable life and it seems so real because it does not attempt to filter out the complexity  
3586,the gentle comic treatment 
3587,is what it is  a nice  harmless date film  
3588,grounded in an undeniable social realism 
3589,feel my eyelids  getting  very  heavy 
3590, ghost ship is pretty landbound  with its leaden acting  dull exposition and telegraphed  surprises   
3591,none of this sounds promising and 
3592,the film is well worthwhile  
3593,patience  respect and affection 
3594,every cliche in the war movie compendium across its indulgent twohourandfifteenminute length 
3595,uncomfortably close to losing my lunch 
3596,to give them credit for  the message of the movie 
3597,remotely new or interesting 
3598,can hear you snore 
3599,says far less about the horrifying historical reality than about the filmmaker s characteristic style 
3600, sloppy 
3601,falls far short 
3602,scherfig  who has had a successful career in tv  tackles more than she can handle  
3603,be hardpressed to find a movie with a bigger  fatter heart than barbershop 
3604,appears jagged  as if filmed directly from a television monitor  while the extensive use of stock footage quickly becomes a tiresome cliché 
3605,see her esther blossom as an actress  
3606,delivers big time 
3607,that is an undeniably worthy and devastating experience 
3608,formulaic  its plot and pacing typical hollywood warmovie stuff 
3609,smear 
3610,a thriller with an edge 
3611,delivers a monologue that manages to incorporate both the horror and the absurdity of the situation in a wellbalanced fashion 
3612,dubious human being 
3613,there s no palpable chemistry between lopez and male lead ralph fiennes  plus the script by working girl scribe kevin wade is workmanlike in the extreme  
3614,conquers 
3615,bottomrung new jack city wannabe  
3616,to show us why it s compelling 
3617,is hardly a masterpiece 
3618, the tale unfolds like a lazy summer afternoon and concludes with the crisp clarity of a fall dawn  
3619,emerge with unimpeachable clarity 
3620,for most of its footage  the new thriller proves that director m night shyamalan can weave an eerie spell and that mel gibson can gasp  shudder and even tremble without losing his machismo  
3621,this film  whose meaning and impact is sadly heightened by current world events 
3622,poorlyconstructed comedy 
3623,aimless as an old pickup skidding completely out of control on a long patch of black ice 
3624,rousing  grated family film 
3625,absurdist wit 
3626,a mess of mixed messages  overblown drama and bruce willis 
3627,hoffman s performance is authentic to the core of his being  
3628,bill morrison s decasia 
3629,usually dread encountering the most 
3630,sure to win viewers  hearts 
3631,ca nt accuse kung pow for misfiring  since it is exactly what it wants to be  an atrociously  mindnumbingly  indescribably bad movie  
3632,must have been lost in the translation  
3633,despite auteuil s performance 
3634,option to slap her creators because they re clueless and inept 
3635,at an idea that should ve been so much more even if it was only made for teenage boys and wrestling fans 
3636,the thin veneer 
3637,the delicate forcefulness 
3638,if the man from elysian fields is doomed by its smallness 
3639,will just as likely make you weep 
3640,s still a guilty pleasure to watch  
3641,like edward norton in american history x  ryan gosling  murder by numbers  delivers a magnetic performance  
3642,nation 
3643,is funny and pithy  while illuminating an era of theatrical comedy that  while past  
3644,scream low budget 
3645,the only camouflage carvey should now be considering is a paper bag to wear over his head when he goes out into public  to avoid being recognized as the man who bilked unsuspecting moviegoers  
3646,of the potential for sanctimoniousness 
3647,interlocked stories drowned by all too clever complexity 
3648,lacks dramatic punch and depth 
3649,david caesar has stepped into the mainstream of filmmaking with an assurance worthy of international acclaim and with every cinematic tool well under his control  driven by a natural sense for what works on screen  
3650,you want to slap it 
3651,great performances  stylish cinematography and 
3652,can enjoy much of jonah simply  and gratefully  as laughoutloud lunacy with a pronounced monty pythonesque flavor  
3653,garden music video 
3654,nice piece of work 
3655,knows everything and answers all questions  is visually smart  cleverly written  and nicely realized 
3656,a rehash 
3657,is it possible for a documentary to be utterly entranced by its subject and still show virtually no understanding of it  
3658,tired old vision 
3659,lame 
3660,snl  hasbeen 
3661,horrible  
3662,a pretentious and 
3663,is a smart movie that knows its classical music  knows its freud and knows its sade 
3664,any movie with a lifeaffirming message 
3665,to the experience 
3666,even worse 
3667,every once in a while  a movie will come along that turns me into that annoying specimen of humanity that i usually dread encountering the most  the fanboy 
3668,wimps out by going for that pg13 rating  so the more graphic violence is mostly offscreen 
3669,tubthumpingly loud 
3670,will leave you with a smile on your face and a grumble in your stomach  
3671,how long will filmmakers copy the  saving private ryan  battle scenes before realizing steven spielberg 
3672,is a welcome lack of pretension about the film  which very simply sets out to entertain and ends up delivering in good measure 
3673,highly uneven 
3674,one of the most exciting action films 
3675,offers nothing more than a baitandswitch that is beyond playing fair with the audience 
3676,is playful but highly studied and dependent for its success on a patient viewer  
3677,clichériddled genre 
3678,a better script 
3679, then go see this delightful comedy  
3680,disguise the slack complacency of  godard s  vision  any more than the gorgeous piano and strings on the soundtrack can drown out the tinny selfrighteousness of his voice 
3681,absurdist 
3682,seem like a bad idea from frame one 
3683,of grace 
3684,bright shining star 
3685,romantic and serenely 
3686,a lyrical metaphor for cultural and personal selfdiscovery and a picaresque view of a littleremembered world  
3687,ick 
3688,it s not a motion picture  it s an utterly static picture 
3689,is far from disappointing  
3690,cliffhanger 
3691,photographed and staged by mendes with a series of riveting set pieces the likes of which mainstream audiences have rarely seen  
3692,its digs at modern society are all things we ve seen before  
3693,fussing over too weak a recipe 
3694,touched by an unprecedented tragedy 
3695,looking for a return ticket to realism 
3696,really is enormously good fun  
3697,includes battlefield earth and showgirls 
3698,for casting  often resurrecting performers who rarely work in movies now  and drawing flavorful performances from bland actors 
3699,overthetop trash 
3700,that should appeal to anyone willing to succumb to it 
3701,because of the universal themes  earnest performances 
3702,makes the same mistake as the music industry it criticizes  
3703,s nothing wrong with that 
3704,convincing portrayal 
3705,it drags during its 112minute length 
3706, it offers much to absorb and even more to think about after the final frame  
3707,quiet  confident craftsmanship that tells a sweet  charming tale of intergalactic friendship 
3708,an engrossing portrait of a man whose engaging manner and flamboyant style made him a truly largerthanlife character  
3709,the film never recovers from the clumsy cliché of the ugly american abroad  
3710,aimless  arduous  and arbitrary 
3711,a lot of the credit for the film s winning tone must go to grant  who has nt lost a bit of the dry humor that first made audiences on both sides of the atlantic love him  
3712,sports extravaganza 
3713,i have always appreciated a smartly written motion picture  and 
3714,loose  poorly structured film 
3715,and as bland 
3716,it must be labeled  hip    innovative  and  realistic  
3717,where the old adage  be careful what you wish for  
3718,its audience giddy 
3719,implies in its wake the intractable  irreversible flow of history 
3720,piercing 
3721,its recycled aspects  
3722,its truetolife characters  
3723,limpid and conventional historical fiction 
3724,pity anyone who sees this mishmash  
3725,dark to be decipherable 
3726,stranded with nothing more than our lesser appetites 
3727,seem to match the power of their surroundings  
3728,that begins as a seven ripoff  only to switch to a mix of the shining  the thing  and any naked teenagers horror flick from the 1980s 
3729,kwan is a master of shadow  quietude  and room noise  
3730,s simply stupid  irrelevant and deeply  truly  bottomlessly cynical 
3731,is dark  brooding and slow 
3732,hand viewers a suitcase full of easy answers 
3733,there is plenty of room for editing  and a much shorter cut surely would have resulted in a smoother  more focused narrative without sacrificing any of the cultural intrigue  
3734,handed down from the movie gods 
3735,are  with the drumming routines  among the film s saving graces  
3736,that it avoids the obvious with humor and lightness 
3737,get excited about on this dvd 
3738,m not sure which will take longer to heal  the welt on johnny knoxville s stomach from a riotcontrol projectile or my own tortured psyche  
3739,of artifice and purpose 
3740,that surprises or delights 
3741,is lost  leaving the character of critical jim twodimensional and pointless  
3742,was immensely enjoyable 
3743,pathosfilled but ultimately lifeaffirming finale 
3744,easier to digest 
3745,contest to see who can outbadact the other 
3746,what an idea  what a thrill ride  
3747,from a television monitor 
3748,no better or worse than  truth or consequences  nm  or any other interchangeable actioner with imbecilic mafia toolbags botching a routine assignment in a western backwater  
3749,enters a realm where few nonporn films venture  and comes across as darkly funny  energetic  and surprisingly gentle  
3750,fresh  sometimes funny  and usually genuinely worthwhile 
3751,a good human 
3752,the most surprising thing about this film 
3753,unfortunately also 
3754,a great american adventure 
3755,imaginative 
3756,of his most daring  and complicated  performances 
3757,aimless  arduous  
3758,too slight to be called any kind of masterpiece 
3759,is where ararat went astray  
3760,prove diverting enough 
3761,to places in the world devastated by war  famine and poverty and documented the cruelty and suffering he has found with an devastating  eloquent clarity 
3762,should nt have been allowed to use the word  new  in its title  because there s not an original character  siuation or joke in the entire movie 
3763,a generic bloodbath 
3764,everything  even life on an aircraft carrier  is sentimentalized  
3765,the novel charm 
3766,pathetic idea 
3767,a bad improvisation exercise  
3768,a major waste  generic 
3769,only surprise 
3770,as beautiful  desirable 
3771,come away thinking not only that kate is nt very bright  but that she has nt been worth caring about and that maybe she  janine and molly  an allwoman dysfunctional family  deserve one another  
3772,wonderful fencing scenes and 
3773,sure  it s contrived and predictable 
3774,absolute joy 
3775,heart as important as humor 
3776,creative energy and wit to entertain all ages 
3777,into a poem of art  music and metaphor 
3778,laughed that hard in years 
3779,this goofily endearing and welllensed gorefest 
3780, assured of the wrong things  and scared to admit how much they may really need the company of others 
3781,mostly fool s gold 
3782,know what it wants to be when it grows up 
3783,its amiable jerking 
3784,emerges as a surprisingly anemic disappointment 
3785,a boring  pretentious muddle 
3786, it s probably not accurate to call it a movie 
3787,gives it new texture  new relevance  new reality 
3788,would anyone cast the magnificent jackie chan in a movie full of stunt doubles and special effects 
3789,not only a pianist  but a good human being 
3790,what could have been a daytime soap opera is actually a compelling look at a young woman s tragic odyssey  
3791,owen wilson know a movie must have a story and a script  
3792,s better to go in knowing full well what s going to happen  but willing to let the earnestness of its execution and skill of its cast take you down a familiar road with a few twists  
3793,driven by a fantastic dual performance from ian holm 
3794,wellputtogether 
3795,is so rich with period minutiae 
3796,grownups should appreciate its whimsical humor 
3797,is good all round  but what really sets the film apart is debrauwer s refusal to push the easy emotional buttons 
3798,more ambivalent set 
3799,i ca nt say this enough  this movie is about an adult male dressed in pink jammies  
3800,rambles aimlessly 
3801,a movie that ca nt get sufficient distance from leroy s delusions to escape their maudlin influence  
3802,sweeping  dramatic 
3803,numbing action sequence made up mostly of routine stuff yuen has given us before  
3804,edits 
3805,is nt entirely persuasive 
3806,smart and wellcrafted 
3807,sit and stare and turn away from one another instead of talking and 
3808,some laughs and a smile 
3809,derived from far less sophisticated and knowing horror films 
3810,so it s not a brilliant piece of filmmaking  but 
3811,the movie is better than you might think  
3812,by a british cast 
3813,an intimate feeling 
3814,recommended  
3815,tormented by his heritage  using his storytelling ability to honor the many faceless victims 
3816,a mood in which an ominous  pervasive  and unknown threat lurks just below the proceedings and adds an almost constant mindset of suspense 
3817,humble  teach and ultimately 
3818,firstclass  natural acting and 
3819,grossout humor 
3820,solemn pretension 
3821,about memory and regret 
3822,best indie of the year  so far  
3823,the byplay and bickering between the now spysavvy siblings  carmen  vega  and juni  sabara  cortez  anchor the film in a very real and amusing giveandtake  
3824,like to be a new yorker  or  really  to be a human being  in the weeks after 911 
3825,fails in making this character understandable  in getting under her skin  in exploring motivation  well before the end 
3826,enjoyable family fare 
3827,a more mythic level 
3828,strong supporting players 
3829,watching the proverbial paint dry would be a welcome improvement 
3830,is a poster movie  a mediocre tribute to films like them  
3831,wellbehaved film 
3832,a genre  the gangstercrime comedy  that wore out its welcome with audiences several years ago 
3833,of a handsome and wellmade entertainment 
3834, you will have completely forgotten the movie by the time you get back to your car in the parking lot  
3835, i ca nt see why any actor of talent would ever work in a mcculloch production again if they looked at how this movie turned out

4024,is its reliance on formula  though 
4025,if you grew up on scooby  you ll love this movie  
4026,it does give a taste of the burning man ethos  an appealing blend of countercultural idealism and hedonistic creativity  
4027,an interesting technical exercise

4072, danny is a frighteningly fascinating contradiction  
4073,adams just copies from various sources  
4074,trashy fun 
4075,as it is a unique  wellcrafted psychological study of grief 
4076,the problem with the mayhem in formula 51 is not that it s offensive  but that it s boring

4087,as tricky and satisfying as any of david mamet s airless cinematic shell games  
4088,a love story as sanguine as its title 
4089,movie dawdle 
4090,those of you who are not an eighth grade girl will most likely doze off during this one  
4091,talk to her is so darned assured  we have absolutely no idea who the main characters are until the film is well under way  and yet it s hard to stop watching  
4092,stay away 
4093,gets under your skin and  some plot blips 
4094,pretty much delivers on that promise  
4095,hard time

4103,genuinely unnerving 
4104,that not only would subtlety be lost on the target audience  
4105,cheaplooking 
4106,a markedly inactive film  city is conversational bordering on confessional  
4107,the whole thing never existed 
4108,it shows us a slice of life that s very different from our own and yet instantly recognizable  
4109,big fat pain  
4110,independent or 
4111,and crude storyline 
4112,the film  it was the unfulfilling  incongruous   wait a second

4124,far more impact 
4125,you come from a family that eats  meddles  argues  laughs  kibbitzes and fights together 
4126,this 90minute postmodern voyage was more diverting and thoughtprovoking than i d expected it to be  
4127,inadequate 
4128,watch  giggle and get an adrenaline boost without feeling like you ve completely lowered your entertainment standards 
4129,hard to dismiss  moody  thoughtful

4133,the peculiarly moral amorality of  woo s  best work 
4134,virtually nothing to show 
4135,the hackneyed story 
4136,is most remarkable not because of its epic scope  but because of the startling intimacy it achieves despite that breadth

4138,veiling tension 
4139,with an eye on preserving a sense of mystery 
4140,justify his exercise 
4141,kitschy goodwill

4145,wise and elegiac  
4146,of the creative act 
4147,a spirited film and a mustsee 
4148,is they have a tendency to slip into hokum  
4149, luridly colored  unidimensional nonsense machine 
4150,its superior cast 
4151,is a remarkably original work 
4152,s appealingly manic and energetic 
4153,an uncluttered  resonant gem that relays its universal points without lectures or confrontations   
4154,actors in bad bear suits enact a sort of interspecies parody of a vh1 behind the music episode 
4155,has merit and  in the hands of a brutally honest individual like prophet jack  might have made a point or two regarding life 
4156,sympathizing with terrorist motivations 
4157,a chore to sit through  despite some firstrate performances by its lead 
4158, wendigo  larry fessenden s spooky new thriller  is a refreshingly smart and newfangled variation on several themes derived from far less sophisticated and knowing horror films  
4159,at once subtle and visceral  the film never succumbs to the trap of the maudlin or tearful  offering instead with its unflinching gaze a measure of faith in the future  
4160,a solid cast 
4161,is worth seeking  
4162,technically 
4163,chuckles 
4164,amounts to little more than punishment 
4165,the music makes a nice album  
4166,like mike is a slight and uninventive movie 
4167,ve seen  eddie  murphy do the genialrogue shtick to death  but because the plot is equally hackneyed 
4168, there is no doubt that krawczyk deserves a huge amount of the credit for the film s thoroughly winning tone  
4169,me no lika da accents so good  but i thoroughly enjoyed the love story 
4170,sheridan had a wonderful account to work from  
4171,stylized sequences 
4172,to be swept away by the sheer beauty of his images 
4173,sinks into bythenumbers territory 
4174,more enjoyable than i expected 
4175,at one man s downfall  brought about by his lack of selfawareness 
4176,men in black ii achieves ultimate insignificance  it s the scifi comedy spectacle as whiffleball epic 
4177,about one in three gags in white s intermittently wise script hits its mark  the rest are padding unashamedly appropriated from the teenexploitation playbook  
4178,a beautiful  timeless and universal tale of heated passions  
4179,s a square  sentimental drama that satisfies  as comfort food often can 
4180,manages  with terrific flair 
4181,its truetolife characters  its sensitive acting  its unadorned view of rural life and the subtle direction of firsttimer hilary birmingham 
4182,on both sides it falls short 
4183,marvelous series 
4184,does nt have all the answers 
4185,the first actor to lead a group of talented friends astray 
4186,seems to have dumped a whole lot of plot in favor of  outrageous gags 
4187,the filmmaker would disagree 
4188,connection or identification frustratingly 
4189,provide insight 
4190,turned out to be a onetrick pony 
4191,s hard to resist 
4192,found in its ability to spoof both black and white stereotypes equally 
4193,rules expecting a slice of american pie hijinks starring the kid from dawson s creek 
4194,short running 
4195,fake  dishonest 
4196, begins on a high note and sustains it beautifully  
4197,then you re in for a painful ride  
4198,director hoffman  his writer and kline s agent should serve detention 
4199,inspired  was a lot funnier 
4200,can do even more damage 
4201,a strong and confident work which works so well for the first 89 minutes  but ends so horrendously confusing 
4202,encouraging to see a threedimensional  average  middleaged woman s experience of selfdiscovery handled with such sensitivity 
4203,quiet  confident 
4204,a legal thriller 
4205,an exercise in cynicism every bit as ugly as the shabby digital photography and muddy sound  
4206,guy gets girl  guy loses girl  audience falls asleep  
4207,s so sloppily written and cast that you can not believe anyone more central to the creation of bugsy than the caterer 
4208,feels as if everyone making it lost their movie mojo 
4209,you do nt care who fires the winning shot 
4210,can only encourage us to see samira makhmalbaf as a very distinctive sensibility  working to develop her own film language with conspicuous success 
4211,better described as a ghost story gone badly awry  
4212,affords to watch jackson  who also served as executive producer  take his smooth  shrewd  powerful act abroad 
4213, thoroughly winning flight of revisionist fancy  
4214,mind crappy movies as much as adults  
4215,deliberately and skillfully 
4216,insomnia is one of the year s best films and pacino gives one of his most daring  and complicated  performances 
4217,too many films 
4218,banal  virulently unpleasant excuse 
4219,an unflinching  complex portrait of a modern israel that is rarely seen onscreen 
4220,are both superb  while huppert  is magnificent  
4221,the film never rises above a conventional  two dimension tale 
4222,smilebutton faces 
4223,admire this film for its harsh objectivity and refusal to seek our tears  our sympathies  
4224,like mike shoots and scores 
4225,the nonetoooriginal premise 
4226,once icet sticks his mug in the window of the couple s bmw and begins haranguing the wife in bad stage dialogue 
4227,a solidly constructed  entertaining thriller that stops short of true inspiration  
4228,leave us with a sense of wonder 
4229,barney s crushingly selfindulgent spectacle 
4230,to smack of a hallmark hall of fame  with a few four letter words thrown in that are generally not heard on television 
4231,did nt care  
4232,precocious 
4233,dog soldiers does nt transcend genre 
4234,a twisted sense of humor 
4235,the powerlunchers do nt care to understand 
4236,performers who rarely work in movies now 
4237,that embraces its oldfashioned themes and in the process comes out looking like something wholly original 
4238,live in them  who have carved their own comfortable niche in the world and have been kind enough to share it 
4239,utilizing 
4240,balance pointed  often incisive satire and unabashed sweetness  
4241,the proverbial paint dry 
4242,once again strands his superb performers in the same old story  
4243,bad and 
4244,ticks off kahlo s lifetime milestones with the dutiful precision of a tax accountant 
4245,michel 
4246, 
4247,deeply humanistic artist 
4248,the good and different idea  of middleaged romance  is not handled well and  except for the fine star performances  there is little else to recommend  never again   
4249,for idiots who do nt care what kind of sewage they shovel into their mental gullets to simulate sustenance 
4250,a rich and intelligent film that uses its pulpy core conceit to probe questions of attraction and interdependence and how the heart accomodates practical 
4251,as brave and challenging as you could possibly expect these days from american cinema 
4252,the only thing to fear about  fear dot com  is hitting your head on the theater seat in front of you when you doze off thirty minutes into the film  
4253,personal tragedy and 
4254,is well suited to capture these musicians in full regalia 
4255,repetitive 
4256,it s more enjoyable than i expected  though  and that s because the laughs come from fairly basic comedic constructs  
4257,despite modest aspirations its occasional charms are not to be dismissed  
4258,the seemingly irreconcilable situation between conservative christian parents and their estranged gay and lesbian children 
4259,joyful 
4260, thanks to the presence of  the king   it also rocks  
4261,they could have been in a more ambitious movie

4267,interesting and 
4268,the package in which this fascinating  and timely  content comes wrapped 
4269,is firstrate  especially sorvino  
4270,anyone who has ever suspected hollywood of being overrun by corrupt and hedonistic weasels 
4271,of the outstanding thrillers of recent years 
4272,purports 
4273,there s not enough substance here to sustain interest for the full 90 minutes  especially with the weak payoff 
4274,with the best of herzog s works 
4275,s plenty to enjoy 
4276,designed as a reverie about memory and regret  
4277,though it lacks the utter authority of a genre gem 
4278,is an ode to unconditional love and compassion garnered from years of seeing it all  a condition only the old are privy to  and  often misconstrued as weakness 
4279,that it churns up not one but two flagrantly fake thunderstorms to underscore the action 
4280,the paranoid claustrophobia of a submarine movie with the unsettling spookiness of the supernatural  why did nt hollywood think of this sooner  
4281,excellent 
4282,incompetent  incoherent or just plain crap 
4283,play out realistically if not always fairly  
4284,imitation movie 
4285,let the subtitles fool you 
4286,a morbid one 
4287,s a shame that the storyline and its underlying themes  finally seem so impersonal or even shallow 
4288,achingly honest 
4289,nice little story 
4290,better effects  better acting and a hilarious kenneth branagh  
4291,tiresome as 9 
4292,mixes in as much humor as pathos to take us on his sentimental journey of the heart 
4293,a plot that crawls along at a snail s pace 
4294, a movie does not proclaim the truth about two lovestruck somebodies  but permits them time and space to convince us of that all on their own  
4295,the bottom tier of blaxploitation flicks 
4296,its awkward structure and a final veering 
4297,is beautiful and mysterious 
4298,is very original 
4299, it is also elevated by it  the kind of movie that you enjoy more because you re one of the lucky few who sought it out  
4300,a rather brilliant little cult item  a pastiche of children s entertainment  superhero comics  and japanese animation 
4301,a confusing drudgery  
4302,sitting through this one 
4303,it s hard to imagine any recent film  independent or otherwise  that makes as much of a mess as this one  
4304,dong never pushes for insights beyond the superficial tensions of the dynamic he s dissecting  
4305,is that it is one that allows him to churn out one mediocre movie after another  
4306,thanks to the presence of  the king   it also rocks  
4307,remarkable performances 
4308,possibly the worst film 
4309,the three leads produce adequate performances  
4310,confusing 
4311,a staggeringly compelling character  a young man whose sharp intellect is at the very root of his contradictory  selfhating  selfdestructive ways 
4312,a bad sign when you re rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects  deaths just so the documentary will be over 
4313,historically significant work 
4314,is exceedingly pleasant 
4315,the numerous scenes of gory mayhem are worth the price of admission  if  gory mayhem  is your idea of a good time 
4316,s hard to imagine anybody ever being  in the mood  to view a movie as harrowing and painful as the grey zone 
4317,compelling new material 
4318,this distinguished actor would stoop so low 
4319,this sloppy  madeformovie comedy special 
4320,is surely 
4321,s far from a groundbreaking endeavor 
4322,probably because it s extremely hard to relate to any of the characters 
4323,exhilarating new interpretation 
4324,that s been done before 
4325,chomp on jumbo ants  pull an arrow out of his back  and

4339,if goodhearted 
4340,is nt heated properly  
4341,gets around to its real emotional business 
4342,more than anything else  kissing jessica stein injects freshness and spirit into the romantic comedy genre  which has been held hostage by generic scripts that seek to remake sleepless in seattle again and again  
4343,that if the video is nt back at blockbuster before midnight  you re going to face frightening late fees 
4344,is the kind of movie during which you want to bang your head on the seat in front of you  at its cluelessness  at its idiocy  at its utterly misplaced earnestness  
4345, hollywood is sordid and disgusting  
4346,stuffing himself into an electric pencil sharpener 
4347,her defiance 
4348,a 90minute  fourstar movie

4357,are sexy 
4358,extraordinary debut from josh koury  
4359,it s dark but has wonderfully funny moments 
4360,scherfig s lighthearted profile of emotional desperation

4362,empathy and pity fogging up the screen  
4363,cheapen 
4364,to begrudge anyone for receiving whatever consolation 
4365,as famous prima donna floria tosca  roberto alagna as her lover mario cavaradossi  and ruggero as the villainous  lecherous police chief scarpia

4387,strong as always 
4388,one big excuse to play one lewd scene after another 
4389,watered down 
4390,reverent  and subtly different 
4391,the bestsustained ideas i have ever seen on the screen 
4392,a good idea 
4393,the jokes are flat  
4394,the director s many dodges and turns add up to little more than a screenful of gamesmanship that s low on both suspense and payoff  
4395,especially her agreeably startling use of closeups and her grace with a moving camera 
4396,grab your kids and run and then probably call the police 
4397,sitcomworthy solutions 
4398,an intensely lived time 
4399,plotting and mindless 
4400,to add the magic that made it all work 
4401,is just too easy to be genuinely satisfying 
4402,an object lesson in period filmmaking 
4403,air of gentle longing 
4404,while remaining one of the most savagely hilarious social critics this side of jonathan swift 
4405,though tom shadyac s film kicks off spookily enough  around the halfway mark it takes an abrupt turn into glucose sentimentality and laughable contrivance  
4406,the best comedy concert movie i ve seen since cho s previous concert comedy film 
4407,than the screenplay  which lags badly in the middle and lurches between notveryfunny comedy  unconvincing dramatics and some lastminute action strongly reminiscent of run lola run 
4408,insomnia loses points when it surrenders to a formulaic bangbang  shootemup scene at the conclusion  
4409,is a careerdefining revelation  
4410,funny and fun 
4411,witty dialog between realistic characters 
4412, why bother with a contemptible imitator starring a  snl  hasbeen acting like an 8yearold channeling roberto benigni  
4413,the cast and crew thoroughly enjoyed themselves and believed in their smallbudget film 
4414,doze off during this one 
4415,watch  giggle 
4416,a gorgeously atmospheric meditation on lifechanging chance encounters 
4417,expands the horizons of boredom to the point of collapse  turning into a black hole of dullness  from which no interesting concept can escape 
4418,all comedy is subversive  but this unrelenting bleak insistence on opting out of any opportunity for finding meaning in relationships or work just becomes sad 
4419,buries an interesting storyline about morality and the choices we make underneath such a mountain of clichés and borrowed images that it might more accurately be titled mr chips off the old block 
4420,baseball movies that try too hard to be mythic 
4421,nights feels more like a quickie tv special than a feature film 
4422,romantic  riveting and handsomely animated  
4423,by its own pretentious selfexamination

4435,marinated in clichés and mawkish dialogue  
4436,sickeningly 
4437,strangely funny 
4438,the irksome  tiresome nature of complacency 
4439,a perfect medium 
4440,plays like a tired tyco ad  
4441,while american adobo has its heart  and its palate  in the right place 
4442,sketchy characters and immature provocations can fully succeed at cheapening it  
4443,if you have the patience for it  you wo nt feel like it s wasted yours 
4444,a classy  sprightly spin on film  
4445,is something of a stiff  an extradry office comedy that seems twice as long as its 83 minutes

4460,forages for audience sympathy like a temperamental child begging for attention  giving audiences no reason to truly care for its decrepit freaks beyond the promise of a reprieve from their incessant whining  
4461,a thoughtful whatif for the heart as well as the mind 
4462,tells a story whose restatement is validated by the changing composition of the nation  
4463,the funny bone 
4464,a film really has to be exceptional to justify a three hour running time  
4465,bad taste 
4466,the only young people who possibly will enjoy it

5126,this is a dark  gritty  sometimes funny little gem  
5127,sometimes charming  sometimes infuriating 
5128,eerily suspenseful  deeply absorbing piece 
5129,instead of a witty expose on the banality and hypocrisy of too much kidvid  we get an ugly  meanspirited lashing out by an adult who s apparently been forced by his kids to watch too many barney videos  
5130,about being subjected to farts  urine  feces  semen  or any of the other foul substances 
5131,a more sheerly beautiful film

5143,this movie plays like an extended dialogue exercise in retard 101  
5144,expect more from director michael apted  enigma  and screenwriter nicholas kazan  reversal of fortune  than this cliche pileup  
5145,almost as offensive 
5146,will make you think twice about what might be going on inside each trailer park you drive past  even if it chiefly inspires you to drive a little faster

5170,the modern master of the chase sequence 
5171,much forced drama in this wildly uneven movie  about a young man s battle with his inescapable past and uncertain future in a very shapable but largely unfulfilling present 
5172,serve no other purpose 
5173,both overplayed and exaggerated 
5174,that s exactly what these two people need to find each other 
5175, this is sure to raise audience s spirits and leave them singing long after the credits roll  
5176,a fairly harmless but ultimately lifeless featurelength afterschool special

5185,be as bored watching morvern callar 
5186,crisp framing  edgy camera work  and 
5187,fathers and sons  and the uneasy bonds between them  rarely have received such a sophisticated and unsentimental treatment on the big screen as they do in this marvelous film  
5188, hayek  throws herself into this dream hispanic role with a teethclenching gusto  she strikes a potent chemistry with molina 
5189,not a film for the faint of heart or conservative of spirit  but for the rest of us  especially san francisco lovers  it s a spirited film and a mustsee  
5190,big  fat  dumb 
5191,spreads itself too thin  
5192,a rumor of angels should dispel it  
5193,what might have emerged as hilarious lunacy in the hands of woody allen or mel brooks  at least during their 70s heyday  comes across as lame and sophomoric in this debut indie feature  
5194,while adding a bit of heart and unsettling subject matter 
5195,solid pedigree 
5196,s the element of condescension  
5197,from a college comedy that s target audience has nt graduated from junior high school 
5198,better off staying on the festival circuit 
5199,exciting and wellpaced 
5200,is without doubt an artist of uncompromising vision  but that vision is beginning to feel  if not morally bankrupt  at least terribly monotonous  
5201,if the essence of magic is its makebelieve promise of life that soars above the material realm  this is the opposite of a truly magical movie  
5202,to mention absolutely refreshed 
5203,a fan of the phrase  life affirming  because it usually means  schmaltzy 
5204,beaten to a pulp in his dangerous game 
5205,staggeringly dreadful romance

5210, achingly human 
5211,it sounds  but strikes a tone that s alternately melancholic  hopeful and strangely funny 
5212,becomes just another voyeuristic spectacle  to be consumed and forgotten 
5213,with memorable zingers 
5214,final verdict  you ve seen it all before  
5215,affectingly 
5216,starts off as a possible argentine american beauty reeks like a room stacked with pungent flowers 
5217,been held hostage by generic scripts that seek to remake sleepless in seattle again and again 
5218,becomes a simplistic story about a dysfunctional parentchild relationship

5224,little crossover appeal to those without much interest in the elizabethans  as well as rank frustration from those in the know about rubbo s dumbeddown tactics  
5225,seem at least passably real 
5226,not exactly assured in its execution 
5227,is a big time stinker

5230,nohe has made a decent  intro  documentary  but 
5231,provides an accessible introduction as well as some intelligent observations on the success of bollywood in the western world 
5232,as stiff  ponderous and charmless as a mechanical apparatus

5293,cheap shocks 
5294,the filmmakers come up with nothing original in the way of slapstick sequences 
5295,the worst  and only  killer website movie 
5296,s difficult to conceive of anyone who has reached puberty actually finding the characters in slackers or their antics amusing  let alone funny  
5297,a glorified sitcom 
5298,reasonable 
5299,just about the best straightup  oldschool horror film of the last 15 years 
5300,an enjoyable feelgood family comedy regardless of race

5302,set in a 1986 harlem that does nt look much like anywhere in new york

5343,it s a treat  a delightful  witty  improbable romantic comedy with a zippy jazzy score  grant and bullock make it look as though they are having so much fun  
5344,ultimately succumbs to cliches and pat storytelling 
5345,at every opportunity to do something clever  the film goes right over the edge and kills every sense of believability  all you have left 
5346,acquires an undeniable entertainment value as the slight  pale mr broomfield continues to force himself on people and into situations that would make lesser men run for cover 
5347,oscar caliber cast does nt live up to material

5361,what elevates the movie above the runofthemill singles blender 
5362, implausible 
5363,with its wry observations 
5364,it is doubtful this listless feature will win him any new viewers 
5365,handled affair  a film about human darkness but etched with a light  yet unsentimental  touch 
5366,for this sort of thing to work  we need agile performers  but the proficient  dull sorvino has no light touch  and rodan is out of his league 
5367,unrelentingly grim  and 
5368,sweetest thing 
5369,in the end  tuck everlasting falls victim to that everlasting conundrum experienced by every human who ever lived  too much to do  too little time to do it in

5371,biography channel 
5372,the tuxedo was nt just bad 
5373,i admire it and yet can not recommend it  because it overstays its natural running time

5419,goofy pleasure 
5420,vin diesel is the man

5517,the achingly unfunny phonce 
5518,captures  in luminous interviews and amazingly evocative film from three decades ago  the essence of the dogtown experience  
5519,certain ambition 
5520,the plot of the comeback curlers is nt very interesting actually  but what i like about men with brooms and what is kind of special is how the film knows what s unique and quirky about canadians 
5521,tendentious intervention into the whowroteshakespeare controversy  
5522,easily become a cold  calculated exercise in postmodern pastiche winds up a powerful and deeply moving example of melodramatic moviemaking 
5523,a cultureclash comedy that  in addition to being very funny  captures some of the discomfort and embarrassment of being a bumbling american in europe  
5524,yourself rooting for the monsters in a horror movie 
5525,it s rare to see a movie that takes such a speedy swan dive from  promising  to  interesting  to  familiar  before landing squarely on  stupid   
5526,the movie  like bartleby  is something of a stiff  an extradry office comedy that seems twice as long as its 83 minutes  
5527,arnold schwarzenegger 
5528,is barely 
5529,the characters are based on stock clichés 
5530,dying 
5531,among the chief reasons brown sugar is such a sweet and sexy film 
5532,dreamy and 
5533,will no doubt rally to its cause  trotting out threadbare standbys like  masterpiece  and  triumph  and all that malarkey  but rarely 
5534,it s a hellish  numbing experience to watch  and 
5535,sarah s dedication to finding her husband seems more psychotic than romantic  
5536,carvey s considerable talents are wasted in it 
5537,thirdrate horror sequels 
5538,it forces you to watch people doing unpleasant things to each other and themselves  and it maintains a cool distance from its material that is deliberately unsettling

5549,a few nifty twists that are so crucial to the genre and another firstrate performance by topbilled star bruce willis 
5550,spiced with the intrigue of academic skullduggery and politics 
5551,the sight of the spaceship on the launching pad is duly impressive in imax dimensions  as are shots of the astronauts floating in their cabins  
5552,is so deadly dull 
5553,interesting cinematic devices  cool visual backmasking   a solid cast 
5554,what s not to like about a movie with a  children s  song that includes the line  my stepdad s not mean  he s just adjusting   
5555,does the trick of making us care about its protagonist and celebrate his victories 
5556,offbeat and fanciful film 
5557,came handed down from the movie gods on a silver platter 
5558, she is merely a charmless witch  
5559,rueful  wry humor 
5560,you re not merely watching history 
5561,fairly revealing 
5562,there surrender  9 and 93 minutes of unrecoverable life 
5563,it was only made for teenage boys and wrestling fans 
5564,tiresome jokes 
5565,a major director 
5566,plenty of laughs 
5567,solaris is rigid and evasive in ways that soderbergh s best films   erin brockovich    out of sight  and  ocean s eleven   never were  
5568,in addition to being very funny 
5569,as lame and sophomoric 
5570,of portraying the devastation of this disease 
5571,sad  sick sight 
5572,spite of clearly evident poverty and hardship 
5573,trying to cope with the mysterious and brutal nature of adults 
5574,s difficult to shrug off the annoyance of that chatty fish 
5575,this is nt exactly profound cinema  but it s goodnatured and sometimes quite funny 
5576,of a genuine and singular artist 
5577,that defies classification and is as thoughtprovoking as it 
5578,technically sumptuous but also 
5579,ungainly 
5580,comes closer to the failure of the third revenge of the nerds sequel 
5581,a delicious  quirky movie 
5582,tunney  brimming with coltish  neurotic energy  holds the screen like a true star  
5583,this is popcorn movie fun with equal doses of action  cheese  ham and cheek  as well as a serious debt to the road warrior   but it feels like unrealized potential 
5584,worth the price of admission 
5585,s funniest and most likeable movie in years  
5586, dishonest 
5587,is having fun with it all 
5588,does nt come close to justifying the hype that surrounded its debut at the sundance film festival two years ago 
5589,have nt laughed that hard in years 
5590,miike 
5591,is kinda wrong in places 
5592,make interesting 
5593,the thematic ironies are too obvious and the sexual politics too smug 
5594,are so few films about the plight of american indians in modern america that skins comes as a welcome  if downbeat  missive from a forgotten front  
5595,very thrilling 
5596,failed jokes 
5597,s a testament to de niro and director michael catonjones that by movie s end  we accept the characters and the film  flaws and all 
5598,best sequel 
5599,is neither light nor magical enough to bring off this kind of whimsy  
5600,this facetious smirk 
5601,fifty years after the fact  the world s political situation seems little different  and  director phillip  noyce brings out the allegory with remarkable skill  
5602,few things more frustrating 
5603,a huge disappointment coming  as it does  from filmmakers and performers of this calibre 
5604,less a documentary and more propaganda 
5605, entertaining comedy

5607,pleasant and engaging enough 
5608, solid  kineticallycharged spy flick worthy 
5609,if i want a real movie 
5610,the character s gripping humanity 
5611,a thoroughly awful movie  dumb  narratively chaotic  visually sloppy  a weird amalgam of  the thing  and a geriatric 
5612,an inuit masterpiece that will give you goosebumps as its uncanny tale of love  communal discord  and justice 
5613,returning director rob minkoff  and screenwriter bruce joel rubin 
5614,fondness for fancy splitscreen  stuttering editing and pompous references to wittgenstein and kirkegaard 
5615,has all of dean s mannerisms and selfindulgence  but none of his sweetness and vulnerability 
5616,and resourceful hero 
5617,for largescale action and suspense

5619,stay afloat 
5620,painfully 
5621,if you love the music  and i do  its hard to imagine having more fun watching a documentary  
5622,can never escape the heart of the boy when the right movie comes along  especially if it begins with the name of star wars 
5623,even kids deserve better  
5624,a better celebration 
5625,too stagey  talky 
5626,neil burger here succeeded in  making the mystery of four decades back the springboard for a more immediate mystery in the present

5628,an autopilot hollywood concoction 
5629,of the impossibly long limbs and sweetly conspiratorial smile 
5630,a skyscraper 
5631,the forced new jersey lowbrow accent uma had 
5632,guess it just goes to show that if you give a filmmaker an unlimited amount of phony blood  nothing good can happen  
5633,drowned me in boredom  
5634,about in thick clouds of denial 
5635,namely  an archetypal desire to enjoy good trash every now and then  
5636,the pacing is deadly  the narration helps little and 
5637,works beautifully as a movie without sacrificing the integrity of the opera  
5638,jerking off 
5639,grade 
5640,the journey is such a mesmerizing one 
5641,starts out like heathers  then becomes bring it on  then becomes unwatchable 
5642,inane  humorless and underinspired  
5643,is so prolonged and boring it is nt even close to being the barnburningly bad movie it promised it would be 
5644,the movie only proves that hollywood no longer has a monopoly on mindless action 
5645,historically significant  and 
5646,gooding offers a desperately ingratiating performance  
5647,donovan  squanders his main asset  jackie chan  and 
5648,humanity or empathy 
5649,is little more than a mall movie designed to kill time  
5650,absurd lengths

5665,to think of any film more challenging or depressing than the grey zone 
5666,his impressively delicate range 
5667,the adventures that happen along the way seem repetitive and designed to fill time  providing no real sense of suspense 
5668,gets full mileage out of the rolling of a stray barrel or the unexpected blast of a phonograph record 
5669,thriller junk 
5670,a lot going for it  not least the brilliant performances by testud  and parmentier 
5671,when you instantly know whodunit 
5672,in theory  a middleaged romance pairing clayburgh and tambor sounds promising  
5673,fun  and 
5674,s really just another major league  
5675,no unifying rhythm or visual style 
5676,a warmth that is nt faked 
5677,the terrifying message 
5678,to a film about a family s joyous life 
5679,decent

5684,shows what great cinema can really do 
5685,lazy

5694,painful as the grey zone 
5695,a backseat in his own film 
5696,sheridan has settled for a lugubrious romance 
5697,romance  tragedy 
5698,to convince the audience that these brats will ever be anything more than losers 
5699,s extremely hard to relate to any of the characters 
5700,it s exactly the kind of movie toback s detractors always accuse him of making  
5701, standoffish to everyone else  and smugly suggests a superior moral tone is more important than filmmaking skill 
5702,should have been a cutting hollywood satire 
5703,imagine  if possible  a pasolini film without passion or politics  or an almodovar movie without beauty or humor  
5704,awesome work

5729,a must 
5730,nothing but an episode of smackdown

5797,wince in embarrassment and others  thanks to the actors 
5798,the leaping story line  shaped by director peter kosminsky into sharp slivers and cutting impressions  shows all the signs of rich detail condensed into a few evocative images and striking character traits  
5799,i d be lying if i said my ribcage did nt ache by the end of kung pow  
5800,is actually a compelling look at a young woman s tragic odyssey  
5801,a chilling movie without oppressive gore

5825,on johnny knoxville s stomach 
5826,more than four 
5827,a wildly erratic drama with sequences that make you wince in embarrassment and others  thanks to the actors  that are quite touching  
5828,not only a reminder of how they used to make movies  but also how they sometimes still can be made  
5829,visually breathtaking 
5830,lack a strongminded viewpoint  or a sense of humor  
5831,excellent choice 
5832,a guarantee 
5833,seems content to dogpaddle in the mediocre end of the pool  and

5849,a dazzling dream of a documentary  
5850,a stirring  funny 
5851,it would be better as a diary or documentary 
5852,this is nt even a movie we can enjoy as mild escapism 
5853,before some savvy producer saw the potential success inherent in the mixture of bullock bubble and hugh goo 
5854,as ugly as the shabby digital photography and muddy sound 
5855,comes off as a kingdom more mild than wild 
5856,screwedup 
5857,uselessly redundant and 
5858,punitive minutes 
5859,would look like something like this 
5860, city by the sea swings from one approach to the other  but in the end  it stays in formula  which is a waste of de niro  mcdormand and the other good actors in the cast  
5861, does nt deserve the energy it takes to describe how bad it is  
5862,unique and quirky 
5863,it s a hoot watching the rock chomp on jumbo ants  pull an arrow out of his back  and leap unscathed through raging fire  
5864,sad to say  it accurately reflects the rage and alienation that fuels the selfdestructiveness of many young people  
5865,is an exercise not in biography but in hero worship

5872,eventually winning squareness that would make it the darling of many a kidsandfamilyoriented cable channel 
5873,an engrossing portrait of uncompromising artists trying to create something original against the backdrop of a corporate music industry that only seems to care about the bottom line

5896,in which the rest of the cast was outshined by ll cool j 
5897,it s dark but has wonderfully funny moments  you care about the characters  and the action and special effects are firstrate

5923,its target audience talked all the way through it 
5924,works better in the conception than it does in the execution  winds up seeming just a little too clever  
5925,imagine a film that begins as a seven ripoff  only to switch to a mix of the shining  the thing  and any naked teenagers horror flick from the 1980s 
5926,its exquisite acting  inventive screenplay  mesmerizing music  and many inimitable scenes 
5927,that s about as subtle as a party political broadcast 
5928,the idea of making kahlo s art a living  breathing part of the movie  often catapulting the artist into her own work 
5929,gives a performance that is masterly  
5930,a wonderous accomplishment 
5931,the master of disguise may have made a great saturday night live sketch  but a great movie it is not  
5932,aggravating and tedious  
5933,an oddly fascinating depiction 
5934,so boring 
5935,the lady and the duke surprisingly 
5936,captivates and shows how a skillful filmmaker can impart a message without bludgeoning the audience over the head

5948,striking 
5949,at the station looking for a return ticket to realism 
5950,puts the  ick  in  classic  
5951,shows us a slice of life that s very different from our own and yet instantly recognizable

5954,genuine laughs 
5955,some of its repartee is still worth hearing

5960,vibrant whirlwind

5966,drudgery  
5967,keep pushing the jokes at the expense of character until things fall apart  
5968,is violated 
5969,i would go back and choose to skip it  
5970,the following things are not at all entertaining  the bad sound  the lack of climax and  worst of all  watching seinfeld  who is also one of the film s producers  do everything he can to look like a good guy 
5971,s a funny little movie with clever dialogue and likeable characters  
5972,behan s memoir is great material for a film  rowdy  brawny and lyrical in the best irish sense 
5973,your dream 
5974,become a household name on the basis of his first starring vehicle 
5975,further sad evidence that tom tykwer  director of the resonant and sensespinning run lola run  has turned out to be a onetrick pony

5977,a slambang extravaganza 
5978,is somehow making its way instead to theaters  
5979,a very lively dream 
5980, with humor  warmth  and intelligence  captures a life interestingly lived 
5981,from its sleazy moralizing 
5982,breathtaking mystery 
5983,woo has as much right to make a huge action sequence as any director  but how long will filmmakers copy the  saving private ryan  battle scenes before realizing steven spielberg got it right the first time  
5984,a lot smarter than your average bond  
5985,transcends its agenda to deliver aweinspiring  at times sublime  visuals and

5992,eyeballs 
5993,the style and flash of the doublecross that made mamet s  house of games  and last fall s  heist  so much fun

5995,skillful and moving 
5996,all the substance of a twinkie  easy to swallow  but scarcely nourishing 
5997,has much to recommend it  
5998,gives a human face to what s often discussed in purely abstract terms

6010, you re too interested to care  
6011,is authentic to the core of his being  
6012,far too clever by half  howard s film is really a series of strungtogether moments  with all the spaces in between filled with fantasies  daydreams  memories and one fantastic visual trope after another  
6013,with an unusual protagonist  a kiltwearing jackson  and subject matter  the improbable  formula 51  is somewhat entertaining

6022,most important and exhilarating forms 
6023,although the more lasciviousminded might be disappointed in the relative modesty of a movie that sports a  topless tutorial service 
6024, a sour little movie at its core  an exploration of the emptiness that underlay the relentless gaiety of the 1920 s  the film s ending has a  what was it all for  
6025,too many scenes toward the end 
6026,s full of cheesy dialogue  but great trashy fun that finally returns de palma to his pulpy thrillers of the early 80s 
6027,a more confused  less interesting and more sloppily 
6028,most ravaging 
6029,equally miserable 
6030,i admire the closing scenes of the film  which seem to ask whether our civilization offers a cure for vincent s complaint  
6031,is one film that s truly deserving of its oscar nomination

6034,entirely suspenseful  extremely wellpaced and ultimately 
6035,editing and pompous references 
6036,inspirational status 
6037, a  poorly executed comedy  
6038,gentle but 
6039,may offend viewers not amused by the sick sense of humor  
6040, this is nt even a movie we can enjoy as mild escapism  it is one in which fear and frustration are provoked to intolerable levels  
6041, the war of the roses   trailertrash style  
6042,accomplished and 
6043,no worse a film than breaking out  and breaking out was utterly charming  
6044,the soulful development

6050,tackles more than she can handle  
6051,losing its focus  point and purpose in a mess of mixed messages  overblown drama and bruce willis 
6052,nothing wrong with performances here  but the whiney characters bugged me  
6053,proves to be sensational 
6054,to entertain 
6055,pathetic exploitation film 
6056,joys in our lives 
6057,the triumph 
6058,of sincere grief and mourning in favor of bogus spiritualism 
6059,unspeakable  of course  barely begins to describe the plot and its complications  
6060,did nt convince me that calvin jr s barbershop represents some sort of beacon of hope in the middle of chicago s south side 
6061,laced with liberal doses of dark humor  gorgeous exterior photography  and a stablefull of solid performances  no such thing is a fascinating little tale  
6062,seems hopelessly juvenile  
6063,a frighteningly fascinating contradiction 
6064,an unpleasant debate that s been given the drive of a narrative and that s been acted out 
6065,equally assured 
6066,have a story and a script 
6067,s a work of enthralling drama 
6068,predictable as the tides 
6069,did no one on the set have a sense of humor  
6070,the film  while it s not completely wreaked  is seriously compromised by that 
6071,s a wonderful  sobering  heartfelt drama 
6072,saves 
6073,uncompromising film 
6074,for making a florid biopic about mad queens  obsessive relationships  and rampant adultery so dull 
6075,all the dramatic weight 
6076,will wind up as glum as mr de niro  
6077,bracing truth 
6078,great trashy fun that finally returns de palma to his pulpy thrillers of the early 80s 
6079,even if it is generally amusing from time to time  i spy has all the same problems the majority of action comedies have  
6080,the movie winds up feeling like a great missed opportunity  
6081,of deadend distaste 
6082,tells its poignant and uplifting story in a stunning fusion of music and images  
6083,good actors  even kingsley  are made to look bad 
6084,young everlyn sampi  as the courageous molly craig  simply radiates starpower potential in this remarkable and memorable film

6087,poor editing  bad bluescreen

6090,believe anyone would really buy this stuff 
6091,lighthearted glow 
6092,that there s really not much of a sense of action 
6093,just another combination of bad animation and mindless violence  
6094, guts and crazy beasts stalking men with guns though  you will likely enjoy this monster

6154,without thrills and a mystery devoid 
6155,playful but highly studied 
6156,fails to portray its literarily talented and notorious subject as anything much more than a dirty old man 
6157,it s leaden and predictable  and 
6158,other hallmarks of his personal cinema painted on their largestever historical canvas 
6159,ailments 
6160,could be the worst film a man has made about women since valley of the dolls

6162,as good 
6163,retains an extraordinary faith in the ability of images

6168,could nt have done any better in bringing the story of spiderman to the big screen  
6169,it feels like unrealized potential

6182, meandering 
6183,humorous and touching 
6184,that so many people put so much time and energy into this turkey 
6185,was the best the contest received 
6186,is the kind of movie that gets a quick release before real contenders arrive in september 
6187,it finds a nice rhythm  
6188,it s not so much a movie as a joint promotion for the national basketball association and teenaged rap and adolescent posterboy lil  bow wow  
6189,settles in and becomes compulsively watchable in a guiltypleasure  daytimedrama sort of fashion 
6190,drains it 
6191,is even worse than i imagined a movie ever could be 
6192,without resorting to camp or parody  haynes  like sirk  but differently  has transformed the rhetoric of hollywood melodrama into something provocative  rich  and strange  
6193,this rush to profits has created a predictably efficient piece of business notable largely for its overwhelming creepiness  for an eagerness to create images you wish you had nt seen  which  in this day and age  is of course the point  
6194,ever so gracefully

6236,different  unusual  even nutty 
6237, nasty journey 
6238,a maddeningly insistent and repetitive piano score that made me want to scream 
6239,dumped a whole lot of plot 
6240,undisciplined 
6241,production exists only to capitalize on hopkins  inclination to play hannibal lecter again  even though harris has no immediate inclination to provide a fourth book 
6242,is painfully bad  
6243,strange film 
6244,despite the mild hallucinogenic buzz  is of overwhelming waste 
6245,seems terrified of the book s irreverent energy  and scotches most of its élan  humor  bile  and irony  
6246,premise  mopes through a dreary tract of virtually plotless meanderings and then ends with a whimper  
6247,a kilt

6257,the humor has point 
6258,cheesy commercialism 
6259,is on full  irritating display 
6260,a firstclass road movie that proves you can run away from home  but your ego 
6261,in the way of a tooconscientious adaptation 
6262,there s nothing like love to give a movie a b12 shot  
6263,director douglas mcgrath takes on nickleby with all the halfhearted zeal of an 8th grade boy delving into required reading  
6264,rarely has a film s title served such dire warning  
6265,an action film disguised as a war tribute is disgusting to begin with 
6266,the movie about the baseballplaying monkey was worse   
6267,re going to feel like you were nt invited to the party 
6268,it is different from others in its genre in that it is does not rely on dumb gags  anatomical humor  or character cliches  
6269,sticks rigidly to the paradigm  rarely permitting its characters more than two obvious dimensions and repeatedly placing them in contrived  wellworn situations  
6270,one ca nt help but be drawn in by the sympathetic characters 
6271,a simple tale of an unlikely friendship  but thanks to the gorgeous locales and exceptional lead performances 
6272,belongs to nicholson 
6273,and if you appreciate the onesided theme to lawrence s overindulgent tirade  then knock yourself out and enjoy the big screen postcard that is a selfglorified martin lawrence lovefest

6317,wicked 
6318,fontaine s direction  especially her agreeably startling use of closeups and her grace with a moving camera  creates sheerly cinematic appeal  
6319,isabelle huppert  again shows uncanny skill in getting under the skin of her characters 
6320,a sobering and powerful documentary about the most severe kind of personal loss

6349,the only thing scary about feardotcom is that the filmmakers and studio are brazen enough to attempt to pass this stinker off as a scary movie  
6350,warm  moving 
6351,so exaggerated and broad 
6352,that stalls in its lackluster gear of emotional blandness 
6353, ferrera  has the charisma of a young woman who knows how to hold the screen

6357,hits its mark 
6358,is remarkably fuddled about motives and context  which drains it of the dramatic substance that would shake us in our boots  or cinema seats   
6359,who might otherwise go unnoticed and underappreciated by music fans 
6360,do nt think so  
6361,represents the worst kind of filmmaking  the kind that pretends to be passionate and truthful but is really frustratingly timid and soggy

6369,a mawkish selfparody 
6370,not only is entry number twenty the worst of the brosnan bunch 
6371,stylish but steady  and ultimately very satisfying  
6372,for a story set at sea  ghost ship is pretty landbound  with its leaden acting  dull exposition and telegraphed  surprises   
6373,it stays in formula  which is a waste of de niro  mcdormand and the other good actors in the cast 
6374,because of its broad racial insensitivity towards africanamericans 
6375,without context  journalistic or historical 
6376, shecute baggage into her lead role as a troubled and determined homicide cop to quite pull off the heavy stuff

6379,softcore twaddle 
6380,there s a delightfully quirky movie to be made from curling  but brooms is nt it  
6381, and motorcycles 
6382,succeeds due to its rapidfire delivery and enough inspired levity that it ca nt be dismissed as mindless  
6383,little too obvious  but 
6384,dragonfly 
6385,created a breathtakingly assured and stylish work of spare dialogue and acute expressiveness 
6386,almost generic 
6387,the goodwill the first half of his movie generates by orchestrating a finale that is impenetrable and dull 
6388,it s got all the familiar bruckheimer elements  and schumacher does probably as good a job as anyone at bringing off the hopkinsrock collision of acting styles and onscreen personas  
6389,entirely appropriately  the tale unfolds like a lazy summer afternoon and concludes with the crisp clarity of a fall dawn  
6390,on its own staggeringly unoriginal terms  this genderbending comedy is generally quite funny  
6391, this cinderella story does nt have a single surprise up its sleeve  
6392,that director sara sugarman stoops to having characters drop their pants for laughs and not the last time 
6393,mistakenidentity

6442,one of the great minds of our times 
6443,audiences are advised to sit near the back and squint to avoid noticing some truly egregious lipnonsynching 
6444,an intense and effective film about loneliness and the chilly anonymity of the environments where so many of us spend so much of our time 
6445,that effortlessly draws you in 
6446,the fluid motion is astounding on any number of levels  including the physical demands made on büttner  and

6479,that celebi could take me back to a time before i saw this movie 
6480,making such a tragedy the backdrop to a love story risks trivializing it  though chouraqui no doubt intended the film to affirm love s power to help people endure almost unimaginable horror  
6481,fascinating  ludicrous  provocative and vainglorious 
6482,has made a movie that will leave you wondering about the characters  lives after the clever credits roll 
6483,too cynical 
6484,spooky and subtly 
6485,into a classic genre 
6486,is too busy getting in its own way to be anything but frustrating  boring  and forgettable 
6487,up walking out not only satisfied but also somewhat touched 
6488,the plot seems a bit on the skinny side 
6489,accompanied by the sketchiest of captions  
6490,melodramatic paranormal romance is an alltime low for kevin costner  
6491,s something of the ultimate scorsese film

6493,loathe him 
6494,hell  i dunno 
6495,for two directors with far less endearing disabilities 
6496,if mostly martha is mostly unsurprising  it s still a sweet  even delectable diversion  
6497,beautiful 
6498,enhanced by a surplus of vintage archive footage 
6499,is that it progresses in such a lowkey manner that it risks monotony  
6500,analyze this movie in three words  thumbs friggin  down 
6501, a film less about refracting all of world war ii through the specific conditions of one man  and more about that man 
6502,makes these lives count

6529,a caffeinated  sloppy brilliance  
6530,for most movies  84 minutes is short  but 
6531,accurate 
6532, the film never succumbs to the trap of the maudlin or tearful  offering instead with its unflinching gaze a measure of faith in the future  
6533,the music makes a nice album  the food is enticing and 
6534,faith  love and power

6565,a sad aristocrat in tattered finery 
6566,get out your pooperscoopers 
6567,a superfluous sequel 
6568,set in the world of lingerie models and bar dancers in the midwest that held my interest precisely because it did nt try to  
6569,if the suspense never rises to a higher level  it is nevertheless maintained throughout 
6570,a feelbad ending 
6571,there s a sheer unbridled delight in the way the story unfurls  
6572,and more entertaining  too  
6573,a certain sense of experimentation and improvisation to this film that may not always work 
6574,an irresistible blend 
6575,in reality it s one tough rock  
6576,captive by mediocrity 
6577,a snore and utter tripe

6589,is priceless 
6590,torture and selfmutilation 
6591,is an inspirational love story  capturing the innocence and idealism of that first encounter  
6592,is nothing less than a provocative piece of work 
6593,even if you do nt know the band or the album s songs by heart  you will enjoy seeing how both evolve  and you will also learn a good deal about the state of the music business in the 21st century

6605,the act is still charming here  
6606,an energetic and engaging film 
6607,is more accurate than anything 
6608,follow the same blueprint from hundreds of other films  sell it to the highest bidder and walk away without anyone truly knowing your identity 
6609,rekindle the magic of the first film 
6610,to take everyone to since there s no new  a christmas carol  out in the theaters this year 
6611,a tired  predictable  bordering on offensive  waste of time  money and celluloid

6888, if you  like me  think an action film disguised as a war tribute is disgusting to begin with  then you re in for a painful ride  
6889,because of its music or comic antics  but through the perverse pleasure of watching disney scrape the bottom of its own cracker barrel

6910,the characters are more deeply thought through than in most  rightthinking  films  
6911,it feels less like bad cinema than like being stuck in a dark pit having a nightmare about bad cinema 
6912,is more like something from a bad clive barker movie  
6913,a sweettempered comedy that forgoes the kneejerk misogyny that passes for humor in so many teenage comedies  
6914,s hard to imagine acting that could be any flatter

7071,when it is nt merely offensive

7126,fosters moments of spontaneous intimacy 
7127,the acting is amateurish  the cinematography is atrocious  
7128,terrible as the synergistic impulse that created it 
7129,this odd  poetic road movie  spiked by jolts of pop music  
7130,charged 
7131,is extremely funny  the first part making up for any flaws that come later 
7132,to say that this vapid vehicle is downright doltish and uneventful 
7133,satin rouge is not a new  or inventive  journey 
7134,selfconsciously flashy camera effects

7141,would be consigned to the dustbin of history 
7142,a thriller whose style  structure and rhythms are so integrated with the story 
7143,the wonderfully lush morvern callar 
7144,the movie is hardly a masterpiece 
7145,clichéd 
7146,stays close to the ground 
7147,hated myself in the morning  
7148,it s provocative stuff  but the speculative effort is hampered by taylor s cartoonish performance and the film s illconsidered notion that hitler s destiny was shaped by the most random of chances  
7149,know why steven seagal is considered a star  nor why he keeps being cast in action films when none of them are ever any good or make any money 
7150, yet not as hilariously raunchy as south park  this strangely schizo cartoon seems suited neither to kids or adults  
7151,interesting and at times

7169,remarkably faithful one 
7170,considering that baird is a former film editor  the movie is rather choppy  
7171,as good as the full monty  but a really strong second effort

7174,somewhat less

7176,nutty cliches and far too much dialogue

7178,a formula that worked five years ago but has since lost its fizz 
7179,an unexpectedly sweet story of sisterhood

7444, city  reminds us how realistically nuanced a robert de niro performance can be when he is not more lucratively engaged in the shameless selfcaricature of  analyze this   1999  and  analyze that   promised  or threatened  for later this year  
7445,another boorish movie

7482,therefore i know better than to rush to the theater for this one 
7483,reactionary ideas about women

7487,the lively appeal of the last kiss 
7488,featuring an oscarworthy performance 
7489,cheap junk 
7490,this lowrent  and even lowerwit  ripoff of the farrelly brothers  oeuvre gets way too mushy  and in a relatively short amount of time  
7491,the movie s ultimate point  that everyone should be themselves  is trite  but 
7492,it just seems manufactured to me and artificial 
7493,it s just too bad the screenwriters eventually shoot themselves in the feet with cop flick cliches like an oily arms dealer  squad car pileups and the requisite screaming captain  
7494, hilarious 
7495,this overlong infomercial  
7496,an intelligent screenplay 
7497,it is sentimental but feels free to offend  is analytical and then surrenders to the illogic of its characters  is about grief and yet permits laughter  
7498,executed with such gentle but insistent sincerity  with such good humor 
7499,had their hearts in the right place  
7500,playwriting 101 premise 
7501,thin notion

7504,that does not move 
7505,something provocative  rich  and strange 
7506,i m sure mainstream audiences will be baffled  but  for those with at least a minimal appreciation of woolf and clarissa dalloway  the hours represents two of those well spent  
7507,an effective portrait 
7508,i ve seen some bad singerturned actors  
7509,too clumsy in key moments  to make a big splash  
7510,send audiences out talking about specific scary scenes or startling moments 
7511,loosely speaking  we re in all of me territory again  and  strictly speaking  schneider is no steve martin  
7512,like a threering circus  there are side stories aplenty  none of them memorable  
7513,a profoundly stupid affair  populating its hackneyed and meanspirited storyline with cardboard characters and performers who value cash above credibility  
7514,slightly disappointed 
7515,proves that he can cross swords with the best of them and helm a more traditionally plotted popcorn thriller while surrendering little of his intellectual rigor or creative composure  
7516,a mustsee for fans of thoughtful war films and those 
7517,could nt keep my attention

7522,i hope the movie is widely seen and debated with appropriate ferocity and thoughtfulness  
7523,loves them to pieces

7525,goodwill 
7526,familyfriendly comedy 
7527,before pulling the plug on the conspirators and averting an americanrussian armageddon

7531,as relationships shift  director robert j siegel allows the characters to inhabit their world without cleaving to a narrative arc  
7532,the right choices at every turn 
7533,reign of fire is hardly the most original fantasy film ever made  beyond road warrior  it owes enormous debts to aliens and every previous dragon drama  but that barely makes it any less entertaining

7536,be captivated 
7537,here a more annoying  though less angry version of the irresponsible sandlerian manchild  undercut by the voice of the star of road trip 
7538,some writer dude  i think his name was  uh  michael zaidan  was supposed to have like written the screenplay or something  but  dude  the only thing that i ever saw that was written down were the zeroes on my paycheck 
7539,will likely 
7540,this oddly sweet comedy about jokester highway patrolmen 
7541,takes a really long  slow and dreary time to dope out what tuck everlasting is about  
7542,the road  where the thematic ironies are too obvious and the sexual politics too smug 
7543,to make the formula feel fresh 
7544,is so insanely dysfunctional that the rampantly designed equilibrium becomes a concept doofus 
7545,the most brilliant work 
7546,from the dullest science fiction 
7547,friendly kick 
7548,suitable 
7549,i bought this movie 
7550, folks  it does nt work  
7551, there is almost nothing in this flat effort that will amuse or entertain them  either  
7552,is a variant of the nincompoop benigni persona 
7553,from  promising  
7554,a romance this smart 
7555,fessenden continues to do interesting work 
7556,will most likely doze off during this one 
7557,a mesmerizing cinematic poem from the first frame to the last  
7558,there are laughs aplenty  and  as a bonus  
7559,the credits roll across the pat ending 
7560, and totally disorientated 
7561,who has never made anything that was nt at least watchable 
7562,d probably turn it off  
7563,warm  moving message 
7564,the script  credited to director abdul malik abbott and ernest  tron  anderson  seems entirely improvised 
7565,feel anything much while watching this movie  beyond mild disturbance or detached pleasure at the acting

7579,will be delighted with the fast  funny  and even touching story  
7580,these jokers are supposed to have pulled off four similar kidnappings before 
7581,from the choppy editing to the annoying score to  special effects  by way of replacing objects in a character s hands below the camera line 
7582,glides gracefully from male persona to female 
7583,world traveler might not go anywhere new  or arrive anyplace special  but it s certainly an honest attempt to get at something 
7584,because there is no earthly reason other than money why this distinguished actor would stoop so low 
7585,yayas everywhere will forgive the flaws and love the film  
7586,pure cinematic intoxication  a wildly inventive mixture of comedy and melodrama  tastelessness and swooning elegance

7599,a comedic moment in this romantic comedy 
7600,simply runs out of ideas

9263,this is a beautiful film for people who like their romances to have that french realism 
9264,wholesome and 
9265,i m guessing the director is a magician

9288,so poorly plotted and scripted  
9289,bears about as much resemblance to the experiences of most battered women as spiderman

9305,a lot of tooth in roger dodger 
9306,the best date movie of the year 
9307,in a film you will never forget  that you should never forget

9316,that makes a depleted yesterday feel very much like a brandnew tomorrow 
9317,the touch is generally light enough and the performances  for the most part  credible  
9318,fastmoving and cheerfully simplistic 
9319,the excitement 
9320,short of profound characterizations 
9321,that a man in drag is not in and of himself funny 
9322,to say that it does nt follow the stale  standard  connectthedots storyline which has become commonplace in movies that explore the seamy underbelly of the criminal world 
9323,like the work of an artist who is simply tired  of fighting the same fights  of putting the weight of the world on his shoulders  of playing with narrative form 
9324,careless and unfocused 
9325,an observant  unfussily poetic meditation 
9326,undercuts the joie de vivre even as he creates it 
9327,one of the most genuinely sweet films 
9328,who will be moved to the edge of their seats by the dynamic first act

9367,great  has solid acting and a neat premise 
9368,do we have that same option to slap her creators because they re clueless and inept 
9369,an autopilot hollywood concoction lacking in imagination and authentic christmas spirit 
9370,agony 
9371,of nearly epic proportions 
9372,filmmaking that is plainly dull and visually ugly when it is nt incomprehensible 
9373,my greatest pictures

9375,modest amusements 
9376,fun of me 
9377, just too bratty for sympathy

9380,a  guy s film  in the worst sense of the expression  
9381,its apparent glee is derived from a lobotomy  having had all its vital essence scooped out and discarded  
9382,scenes all end in someone screaming  
9383,plays like an unbalanced mixture of graphic combat footage and almost saccharine domestic interludes that are pure hollywood

9386,grittily beautiful film 
9387,left in the broiling sun for a good three days 
9388, is inspiring  ironic  and revelatory of just how ridiculous and moneyoriented the record industry really is  
9389,too deep 
9390, the film is  arguably  the most accomplished work to date from hong kong s versatile stanley kwan  
9391,an opportunity missed  
9392,works because of the ideal casting of the masterful british actor ian holm as the aged napoleon

9480,s as lumpy as twoday old porridge

9515,the real triumphs 
9516, it s one of the most beautiful  evocative works i ve seen

9519,as comedic spotlights go  notorious cho hits all the verbal marks it should  
9520,in this oddly sweet comedy about jokester highway patrolmen 
9521,it s hard to imagine that even very small children will be impressed by this tired retread  
9522,a culture clash comedy only half as clever as it thinks it is  
9523,every joke is repeated at least 
9524,makes the silly spy vs spy film the sum of all fears  starring ben affleck  seem downright hitchcockian 
9525,is flat

9527,a cutandpaste of every bad actionmovie line in history 
9528,as an intellectual exercise  an unpleasant debate that s been given the drive of a narrative and that s been acted out  the believer is nothing less than a provocative piece of work 
9529,the film s vision of sport as a secular religion is a bit cloying 
9530,the pacing is deadly  the narration helps little and naipaul  a juicy writer  is negated  
9531,is genial and decent 
9532,heavy on the atmospheric weirdness

9539,commands attention 
9540,barely manages for but a few seconds over its seemingly eternal running time to pique your interest  your imagination  your empathy or anything  really  save your disgust and your indifference  
9541,a powerful performance 
9542,even those with an avid interest in the subject will grow impatient 
9543,it s definitely not made for kids or their parents  for that matter  and i think even fans of sandler s comic taste may find it uninteresting 
9544,an interesting look at the life of the campaigntrail press  especially ones 
9545,is nt this painfully forced  false and fabricated 
9546,their way around this movie directionless  
9547, it s still not a good movie

9551,enthusiasm 
9552,the story together frustrating difficult 
9553,there s much tongue in cheek in the film and there s no doubt the filmmaker is having fun with it all 
9554,a fragile framework upon which to hang broad  mildly fleshedout characters that seem to have been conjured up only 10 minutes prior to filming

9583,by halfway through this picture i was beginning to hate it  and  of course  feeling guilty for it  then  miracle of miracles  the movie does a flipflop  
9584,that comes along only occasionally  one so unconventional  gutsy and perfectly 
9585,relegated 
9586,et works because its flabbergasting principals  14yearold robert macnaughton  6yearold drew barrymore and 10yearold henry thomas  convince us of the existence of the wise  wizened visitor from a faraway planet

9600,find yourself rooting for the monsters in a horror movie 
9601,the plot of the comeback curlers is nt very interesting actually  
9602, this is more appetizing than a side dish of asparagus  
9603,a delightful  if minor  pastry of a movie 
9604,despite an overwrought ending  the film works as well as it does because of the performances  
9605,s nothing interesting in unfaithful whatsoever 
9606,something awfully deadly about any movie with a lifeaffirming message 
9607,it s mildly sentimental  unabashedly consumerist  studiously inoffensive and completely disposable  
9608,describing badness 
9609,undeterminable 
9610,the acting is fine but the script is about as interesting as a recording of conversations at the walmart checkout line  
9611,the story is predictable  the jokes are typical sandler fare  
9612,runteldat is something of a triumph  
9613,  orange county  is far funnier than it would seem to have any right to be  
9614,as exciting as all this exoticism might sound to the typical pax viewer  the rest of us will be lulled into a coma

9624,feels homogenized and a bit contrived 
9625,bad alternative music 
9626,enough  but nothing new 
9627,world cinema s most wondrously gifted artists

10083,know the picture is in trouble  
10084,this film is an act of spiritual faith  an eloquent  deeply felt meditation on the nature of compassion  
10085,a movie that s held captive by mediocrity  
10086,the film fails to fulfill its own ambitious goals 
10087,damagedgoods 
10088,what s really so appealing about the characters is their resemblance to everyday children

10092,s why sex and lucia is so alluring  
10093,is   scooby  do nt 
10094,no new plot conceptions or environmental changes  just different bodies for sharp objects to rip through  
10095,obviously  a lot of people wasted a lot of their time  including mine  on something very inconsequential  
10096,ourselves surprised at how much we care about the story 
10097,with a pleasing verisimilitude 
10098,the dignity of an action hero motivated by something more than franchise possibilities 
10099,achingly human 
10100,it s pretentious in a way that verges on the amateurish  
10101,no one can doubt the filmmakers  motives  but the guys still feels counterproductive

10110,a sea of visual and verbal clichés 
10111,the characters seem onedimensional 
10112,of the recent hollywood trip tripe 
10113,the real star of this movie is the score  as in the songs translate well to film  and it s really well directed 
10114,drowned out by director jon purdy s sledgehammer sap 
10115,cho s latest comic set is nt as sharp or as fresh as i m the one that i want  but it s still damn funny stuff 
10116,wo nt score points for political correctness 
10117,does nt sustain interest beyond the first halfhour  
10118,to laugh at how bad 
10119,enchanting  
10120,it s fairly solid  not to mention well edited so that it certainly does nt feel like a film that strays past the two and a half mark  
10121,who cares

10123,to do a little fleeing of its own

10136,fuels the selfdestructiveness of many young people 
10137,profound humanity 
10138,the chateau belongs to rudd  whose portrait of a therapydependent flakeball spouting french malapropisms  is a nonstop hoot  
10139,as tryingly as the title 
10140,a hugely enjoyable film about changing times  clashing cultures and the pleasures of a wellmade pizza 
10141,if disney s cinderella proved that  a dream is a wish your heart makes   then cinderella ii proves that a nightmare is a wish a studio s wallet makes  
10142,it s rare that a movie can be as intelligent as this one is in every regard except its storyline  everything that s good is ultimately scuttled by a plot that s just too boring and obvious  
10143,a rich tale of our times

10160,entry number twenty the worst of the brosnan bunch 
10161,s all stitched together with energy  intelligence and verve  enhanced by a surplus of vintage archive footage 
10162,is the kind of movie during which you want to bang your head on the seat in front of you  at its cluelessness  at its idiocy  at its utterly misplaced earnestness 
10163,to great artistic significance 
10164,little emotional resonance 
10165,revelatory and

10176,while the story s undeniably hard to follow  iwai s gorgeous visuals seduce  
10177,wanted to leave

10512, pratfalls  dares  injuries  etc  
10513,the leads are so unmemorable  despite several attempts at lengthy dialogue scenes  that one eventually resents having to inhale this gutter romancer s secondhand material

10551,spectacle and pacing 
10552,this engaging mix of love and bloodletting 
10553,psychologically unpersuasive 
10554,it s light on the chills and heavy on the atmospheric weirdness  and there are moments of jawdroppingly odd behavior  yet i found it weirdly appealing  
10555, he showcases davies as a young woman of great charm  generosity and diplomacy 
10556,before it takes a sudden turn and devolves into a bizarre sort of romantic comedy  steven shainberg s adaptation of mary gaitskill s harrowing short story  is a brilliantly played  deeply unsettling experience  
10557,targeted to the tiniest segment of an already obscure demographic  
10558,the surprise ending 
10559,filmed more irresistibly than in  baran 
10560,s muy loco  but no more ridiculous 
10561,the animated sequences are well done and perfectly constructed to convey a sense of childhood imagination and creating adventure out of angst  
10562,with a tawdry bmovie scum

10569,a crass and insulting homage 
10570,s rarely as moronic as some campus grossout films 
10571,is ultimately effective enough at achieving the modest  crowdpleasing goals it sets for itself  
10572,sitting through dahmer s two hours amounts to little more than punishment  
10573,of a predictable outcome and a screenplay

10605,contrived  awkward and filled with unintended laughs  the film shows signs that someone other than the director got into the editing room and tried to improve things by making the movie go faster  
10606,it s a visual rorschach test and i must have failed  
10607,wellmade but mushhearted

11075, profane and exploitative as the most offensive action flick you ve ever seen  
11076,carefully choreographed atrocities  which become strangely impersonal and abstract 
11077,it s a very entertaining  thoughtprovoking film with a simple message 
11078,there s already been too many of these films  
11079,american actionadventure buffs 
11080,succeeds 
11081,is fatal for a film that relies on personal relationships 
11082,one long  numbing action sequence made up mostly of routine stuff yuen has given us before  
11083,hard  endearing  caring  
11084,the pairing does sound promising in theory  but their lack of chemistry makes eddie murphy and robert deniro in showtime look like old  familiar vaudeville partners

11092,s a talking head documentary  but a great one 
11093, the dialogue sounds like horrible poetry

11103,that jack nicholson makes this man so watchable is a tribute not only to his craft  but to his legend  
11104,so stilted and unconvincing 
11105,wonderful  ghastly film 
11106,of the highest and the performances 
11107,can not mount a cogent defense of the film as entertainment  or even performance art  although the movie does leave you marveling at these guys  superhuman capacity to withstand pain  
11108,it is ok for a movie to be something of a sitcom apparatus  if the lines work  the humor has point 
11109,little more than punishment 
11110,he does best 
11111,great to look at 
11112,the absence of narrative continuity 
11113,a moving tale of love and destruction 
11114,a much better documentary  more revealing  more emotional and more surprising  than its pedestrian english title would have you believe  
11115,sketchy it amounts to little more than preliminary notes for a sciencefiction horror film 
11116,s more enjoyable than i expected  
11117, dramatically forceful  and beautifully shot 
11118,everything was as superficial as the forced new jersey lowbrow accent uma had  
11119,slather clearasil over the blemishes of youth 
11120,an intelligent flick that examines many different ideas from happiness to guilt in an intriguing bit of storytelling 
11121, i pledge allegiance to cagney and lacey  
11122,reel in when we should be playing out 
11123,seem appealing 
11124,beautifully shot 
11125,s quite an achievement to set and shoot a movie at the cannes film festival and yet fail to capture its visual appeal or its atmosphere  
11126,of being overrun by corrupt and hedonistic weasels 
11127,it s been 13 months and 295 preview screenings since i last walked out on a movie 
11128,strange it is  but delightfully so  
11129,has in fact come closer than anyone could desire to the cheap  graceless  hackneyed scifi serials of the 30s and 40s 
11130,serious reworking to show more of the dilemma  rather than have his characters stage shouting 
11131,pleasant but not 
11132,who handily makes the move from pleasing 
11133,torments and angst 
11134,works because its flabbergasting principals  14yearold robert macnaughton  6yearold drew barrymore and 10yearold henry thomas  convince us of the existence of the wise  wizened visitor from a faraway planet 
11135,is ultimately rather silly and overwrought  
11136,saccharine genre 
11137,high points to keep this from being a complete waste of time 
11138,the problem is that the movie has no idea of it is serious or not  
11139,genuinely 
11140, casting excellent latin actors of all ages  
11141,does give a pretty good overall picture of the situation in laramie following the murder of matthew shepard  
11142,a strangely 
11143,abundant humanism 
11144,is the heart and soul of cinema 
11145,to seek and strike just the right tone 
11146,it s rare for any movie to be as subtle and touching as the son s room  
11147,poorly structured 
11148, spiderman  certainly 
11149,what s so striking about jolie s performance is that she never lets her character become a caricature  not even with that radioactive hair  
11150,sounds promising 
11151,then again  i hate myself most mornings  
11152,a slice of counterculture 
11153,unrelentingly grim 
11154,signals director rick famuyiwa s emergence as an articulate  grownup voice in africanamerican cinema  
11155,such a wildly uneven hitandmiss enterprise 
11156,the imax screen enhances the personal touch of manual animation  
11157,also asks its audience  in a heartwarming  nonjudgmental kind of way  to consider what we value in our daily lives 
11158,has crafted an engaging fantasy of flavors and emotions  one part romance novel  one part recipe book  
11159,feast 
11160,cleverly captures the dry wit that s so prevalent on the rock 
11161,glorious spectacle

11163,the offcenter humor is a constant 
11164,staged violence overshadows everything

11166,the ensemble cast  the flat dialogue by vincent r nebrida or 
11167,attempt to build up a pressure cooker of horrified awe 
11168,started with a great premise 
11169,reaches across time and distance 
11170,there s an admirable rigor to jimmy s relentless anger  and to the script s refusal of a happy ending 
11171,if you have nothing better to do with 94 minutes 
11172,has secrets buried at the heart of his story and knows how to take time revealing them 
11173,will not be for much longer 
11174,an hour and a half of joyful solo performance 
11175,the sentimental ohthosewackybrits genre 
11176,kind 
11177,is a towering siren  
11178,the toohotfortv directtovideodvd category  and 
11179,gives us episodic choppiness  undermining the story s emotional thrust 
11180,the only fun part of the movie is playing the obvious game  
11181, like max rothman s future  does not work  
11182,it all the more compelling

11184,cheery and 
11185,want to smash its face in 
11186,for that sense of openness  the little surprises 
11187,the human story is pushed to one side 
11188,highly uneven and 
11189,kissing jessica stein injects freshness and spirit into the romantic comedy genre  which has been held hostage by generic scripts that seek to remake sleepless in seattle again and again  
11190,fudges fact and fancy with such confidence that we feel as if we re seeing something purer than the real thing 
11191,of drooling idiots 
11192,poorly executed comedy  
11193,really bad blair witch project 
11194,leaves him shooting blanks

11196,formidable 
11197,a ton of laughs that everyone can enjoy 
11198,the viewer to doze off for a few minutes or make several runs to the concession stand andor restroom and not feel as if he or she has missed anything 
11199,it s a terrible movie in every regard  and utterly painful to watch  
11200,that it s also too stupid to realize that they ve already seen this exact same movie a hundred times 
11201,realizes a fullness that does not negate the subject 
11202,is solid 
11203,particularly well made 
11204,by a master 
11205,of deja vu 
11206,at times a bit melodramatic and even a little dated  depending upon where you live   ignorant fairies is still quite goodnatured and not a bad way to spend an hour or two  
11207,hollow  selfindulgent  and 
11208, not as gloriously flippant as lock  stock and two smoking barrels  
11209,a great cast and 
11210,richly entertaining and suggestive 
11211,drawing flavorful performances 
11212,after one gets the feeling that the typical hollywood disregard for historical truth and realism is at work here  it s a matter of finding entertainment in the experiences of zishe and the fiery presence of hanussen  
11213,to avoid being recognized as the man who bilked unsuspecting moviegoers 
11214,to an imitation movie 
11215,deeply satisfying 
11216,that if you shoot something on crummylooking videotape  it must be labeled  hip    innovative  and  realistic  
11217,yawning 
11218,what s most offensive is nt the waste of a good cast  but the film s denial of sincere grief and mourning in favor of bogus spiritualism  
11219,a terrible movie

11253,plays it straight  turning leys  fable into a listless climb down the social ladder 
11254,worst film 
11255,having much that is fresh to say about growing up catholic or  really  anything

11268,bowling for columbine  remains a disquieting and thoughtprovoking film  
11269,a dashing and absorbing outing with one of france s most inventive directors  
11270,chaplin and kidman  who are capable of anteing up some movie star charisma when they need it to sell us on this twisted love story  but who can also negotiate the movie s darker turns

12106,the film lapses 
12107,an illconceived jumble that s not scary  not smart and not engaging  
12108,increasingly incoherent 
12109, you re desperate for the evening to end  
12110,bears more than a whiff of exploitation  
12111,it forces you to watch people doing unpleasant things to each other and themselves  and 
12112,is a movie filled with unlikable  spiteful idiots  
12113,i like all four of the lead actors a lot and they manage to squeeze a few laughs out of the material 
12114,at a time when commercialism has squeezed the life out of whatever idealism american moviemaking ever had 
12115,reminds us how realistically nuanced a robert de niro performance can be when he is not more lucratively engaged in the shameless selfcaricature of  analyze this   1999  and  analyze that   promised  or threatened  for later this year 
12116,jason patric and ray liotta make for one splendidly cast pair  
12117,if pointless excursion 
12118,that should have been the ultimate imax trip

12129,loses its sense of humor in a vat of failed jokes  twitchy acting  and general boorishness  
12130,we never feel anything for these characters  
12131,rather frightening 
12132,thought would leave you cold 
12133,overlyfamiliar and poorlyconstructed comedy 
12134,alluring 
12135,captures  in luminous interviews and amazingly evocative film from three decades ago 
12136,it s going to be a trip 
12137,story becomes a hopeless  unsatisfying muddle 
12138,rom the performances and the cinematography to the outstanding soundtrack and unconventional narrative 
12139,while demonstrating vividly that the beauty and power of the opera reside primarily in the music itself 
12140,that it succeeds in entertaining  despite playing out like a featurelength sitcom replete with stereotypical familial quandaries 
12141,an hourandahalflong commercial for britney s latest album 
12142,because it plays everything too safe 
12143,botched 
12144,the superficial tensions of the dynamic he s dissecting 
12145,the wanton slipperiness 
12146,the silly and crude storyline 
12147,set out to lampoon  anyway 
12148,itself  as well its delightful cast  is so breezy 
12149,this seductive tease of a thriller 
12150,nightmare 
12151,if you re looking for an intelligent movie in which you can release your pent up anger  enough is just the ticket you need  
12152,lacks even the most fragmented charms i have found in almost all of his previous works 
12153,reality tv obsession 
12154,surprisingly inoffensive 
12155,the women look more like stereotypical caretakers and moral teachers  instead of serious athletes 
12156,her reallife persona is so charmless and vacant 
12157,strong themes of familial ties 
12158,is intriguing  provocative stuff  
12159,great party 
12160,it s equally distasteful to watch him sing the lyrics to  tonight   
12161,seems to play on a 10year delay 
12162,made mamet s  house of games  and last fall s  heist  so much fun 
12163, seagal s  strenuous attempt 
12164,the action is stilted and the tabloid energy embalmed 
12165,every indulgent  indie trick in the book 
12166,maybe leblanc thought   hey  the movie about the baseballplaying monkey was worse   
12167,ll be rewarded with some fine acting  
12168,shows he can outgag any of those young whippersnappers making moving pictures today  
12169,so bad in a major movie 
12170,this is pure  exciting moviemaking  
12171,suitable summer entertainment 
12172,in the end  the movie bogs down in insignificance  saying nothing about kennedy s assassination and revealing nothing about the pathology it pretends to investigate  
12173,its exquisite acting 
12174, evans is no hollywood villain 
12175,for too long and bogs down in a surfeit of characters and unnecessary subplots 
12176,central flaw 
12177,of its pretensions 
12178,it was written for no one 
12179,of the most appealing movies ever made about an otherwise appalling  and downright creepy  subject  a teenage boy in love with his stepmother 
12180, nor why he keeps being cast in action films when none of them are ever any good 
12181,a nosurprise series of explosions and violence while banderas looks like he s not trying to laugh at how bad 
12182,from too much norma rae and not enough pretty woman 
12183,s his strongest performance since the doors 
12184,horrible 
12185,gradually accumulates more layers 
12186,bad prose 
12187,lies a plot cobbled together from largely flat and uncreative moments  
12188,the thought of watching this film with an audience full of teenagers fixating on its body humor and reinforcement of stereotypes  of which they ll get plenty  
12189,so much crypt mist in the brain 
12190,as if de palma spent an hour setting a fancy table and then served up kraft macaroni and cheese 
12191,hard to conceive anyone else in their roles 
12192,a work that lacks both a purpose and a strong pulse  
12193,is in many ways a conventional  even predictable remake 
12194,drama of temptation  salvation and good intentions is a thoughtful examination of faith  love and power  
12195,just plain crap 
12196,this is a movie that refreshes the mind and spirit along with the body  
12197,plodding action sequences

12199,visually ravishing 
12200,phenomenal performances

12206,is greatness here 
12207,comfortable niche 
12208,it s never as solid as you want it to be 
12209,i d recommend waiting for dvd and just skipping straight to her scenes  
12210,like its title character  this nicholas nickleby finds itself in reduced circumstances  and  also like its hero  it remains brightly optimistic  coming through in the end

12256,but certainly not without merit 
12257,showing us wellthought stunts or a car chase 
12258,its excellent use 
12259,s fun for kids of any age  
12260,is as uncompromising as it is nonjudgmental  and makes clear that a prostitute can be as lonely and needy as any of the clients 
12261,it is nt very good 
12262,calls attention to a problem hollywood too long has ignored 
12263,the sword fighting is well done and auteuil is a goofy pleasure  
12264,so overwrought you d swear he just stepped out of a buñuel retrospective 
12265,it squanders chan s uniqueness  it could even be said to squander jennifer love hewitt  
12266,tykwer s surface flash is nt just a poor fit with kieslowski s lyrical pessimism  it completely contradicts everything kieslowski s work aspired to  including the condition of art  
12267,is surprisingly brilliant

12528,the kind of primal storytelling that george lucas can only dream of 
12529,is a risky venture that never quite goes where you expect and often surprises you with unexpected comedy  
12530,an epic rather than 
12531,two unrelated shorts that falls far short 
12532,as compelling or as believable

12565,terminally brain dead production 
12566,holds as many good ideas as bad is the cold comfort that chin s film serves up with style and empathy  
12567,too many scenarios in which the hero might have an opportunity to triumphantly sermonize

12578,i had a lot of problems with this movie  
12579,ingenious 
12580,is too calm and thoughtful for agitprop  and the thinness of its characterizations makes it a failure as straight drama  
12581,a sexy  surprising romance 
12582,i can imagine this movie as a b  w british comedy  circa 1960  with peter sellers  kenneth williams  et al  but at this time  with this cast  this movie is hopeless  
12583,seems a prostituted muse  
12584,sets the film apart is debrauwer s refusal to push the easy emotional buttons 
12585,does nt have the necessary selfcontrol to guide a loose  poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy  
12586,could make you weep 
12587,gothvampire  tortured woeisme lifestyle 
12588,predictable and cloying  though brown sugar is so earnest in its yearning for the days before rap went nihilistic that it summons more spirit and bite than your average formulaic romantic quadrangle

12656,production values  christian bale s charisma make up for a derivative plot 
12657,this odd  poetic road movie  spiked by jolts of pop music  pretty much takes place in morton s everwatchful gaze

12733,that will leave you wondering about the characters  lives after the clever credits roll

12885,selfdeprecating  biting and witty feature

12888,routine stuff yuen 
12889,vile  incoherent mess 
12890,while cleverly worked out

12905,pan nalin s exposition is beautiful and mysterious

12915,wears 
12916,deeply unpleasant 
12917,the only thing avary seems to care about 
12918,a fastmoving and cheerfully simplistic 88 minutes of exaggerated action 
12919,i think even fans of sandler s comic taste may find it uninteresting 
12920,maintains a surprisingly buoyant tone throughout  notwithstanding some of the writers  sporadic dips 
12921,everybody else is in the background and it just seems manufactured to me and artificial 
12922,the film s gamble to occasionally break up the liveaction scenes with animated sequences pays off  as does its sensitive handling of some delicate subject matter  
12923,nonsensical 
12924,sustain laughs 
12925,mannerisms and selfindulgence 
12926,is a tribute not only to his craft  but to his legend

12939,to some talented performers 
12940,a conventional thriller evolves into a gorgeously atmospheric meditation on lifechanging chance encounters 
12941,it appears to have been made by people to whom the idea of narrative logic or cohesion is an entirely foreign concept

12943,guest appearance 
12944,it s a pedestrian  flat drama that screams out  amateur  in almost every frame  
12945,an inelegant combination of two unrelated shorts that falls far short of the director s previous work in terms of both thematic content and narrative strength  
12946,hart s war seems to want to be a character study  but apparently ca nt quite decide which character

12955,the empty stud knockabout of equilibrium 
12956,more time appears to have gone into recruiting the right bands for the playlist and the costuming of the stars than into the script  which has a handful of smart jokes and not much else  
12957,during which you want to bang your head on the seat in front of you  at its cluelessness  at its idiocy  at its utterly misplaced earnestness 
12958,it wears you down like a dinner guest showing off his doctorate 
12959,this story gets sillier  not scarier  as it goes along  
12960,can actually feel good 
12961,some weird masterpiece theater sketch with neither

12994,leads up to a strangely sinister happy ending 
12995,a stirring  funny and 
12996,it s because there s no discernible feeling beneath the chest hair 
12997,this indie flick never found its audience  probably because it s extremely hard to relate to any of the characters

13003,relentlessly saccharine 
13004,a handsome but unfulfilling suspense drama more 
13005,really gives the film its oomph 
13006,the screenwriters eventually shoot themselves in the feet with cop flick cliches like an oily arms dealer  squad car pileups and the requisite screaming captain 
13007,a waterlogged version of  fatal attraction  for the teenybopper set  a sad  soggy potboiler that wastes the talents of its attractive young leads  
13008,cinematic intoxication  a wildly inventive mixture of comedy and melodrama  tastelessness and swooning elegance 
13009,silly summer entertainment 
13010,those who are only mildly curious  i fear  will be put to sleep or bewildered by the artsy and often pointless visuals  
13011,is a funny  puzzling movie ambiguous enough to be engaging and oddly moving 
13012,goes easy on the reelreal world dichotomy that  jaglom  pursued with such enervating determination in venicevenice  
13013, david caesar has stepped into the mainstream of filmmaking with an assurance worthy of international acclaim and with every cinematic tool well under his control  driven by a natural sense for what works on screen  
13014,rich and intelligent film

13016,may be lovely 
13017,its broad racial insensitivity 
13018,feels more like the pilot episode of a tv series than a feature film

13020,seriously bad 
13021,shock and amaze 
13022,it were  well  more adventurous 
13023,mimics everyone and everything

13054,life affirming and heartbreaking  sweet without the decay factor  
13055,one in clockstoppers  a scifi thriller as lazy as it is interminable 
13056,the documentary is much too conventional  lots of boring talking heads  etc  to do the subject matter justice  
13057,was nt a good movie 
13058,is very much of a mixed bag  with enough negatives 
13059,is a masterfully conducted work 
13060,that constantly defies expectation

13062,the unmistakable stamp of authority 
13063,it would be like to be smack in the middle of a war zone armed with nothing but a camera 
13064,a rude black comedy about the catalytic effect a holy fool has upon those around him in the cutthroat world of children s television  
13065,beautiful  
13066,the artwork is spectacular and 
13067,to sit still for two hours and change watching such a character  especially when rendered in as flat and impassive a manner as phoenix s

13074,this dumas adaptation entertains 
13075,i can imagine this movie as a b  w british comedy  circa 1960  with peter sellers  kenneth williams  et al  but at this time  with this cast  this movie is hopeless 
13076,is like cold porridge with only the odd enjoyably chewy lump 
13077,whiny and 
13078,only to keep letting go at all the wrong moments 
13079,most practiced 
13080,intolerant

13089,getting tired of the whole slomo  doublepistoled  ballisticpyrotechnic hong kong action aesthetic

13106,it will be  
13107,lets you brush up against the humanity of a psycho  
13108,thrilling 
13109,is that the filmmakers and studio are brazen enough to attempt to pass this stinker off as a scary movie 
13110,the action quickly sinks into bythenumbers territory  
13111, but wanes in the middle 
13112,insensitivity 
13113, find an escape clause and avoid seeing this trite  predictable rehash  
13114,was put through torture for an hour and a half

13127,unabashedly romantic picture 
13128,it s a funny nobrainer 
13129,one of those movies that catches you up in something bigger than yourself  namely  an archetypal desire to enjoy good trash every now and then  
13130,a darkaspitch comedy 
13131,has the air of a surprisingly juvenile lark  a popinfluenced prank whose charms are immediately apparent and wear thin with repetition  
13132,is ultimately scuttled by a plot that s just too boring and obvious 
13133,this region and 
13134,for quality and a nostalgic  twisty yarn that will keep them guessing 
13135,drivel 
13136,nicholson s goofy  heartfelt  mesmerizing king lear 
13137,itself is actually quite vapid  
13138, less a story than an inexplicable nightmare  right down to the population s shrugging acceptance to each new horror  
13139, trouble every day is a plodding mess  
13140,needless chase scenes and swordfights as the revenge unfolds 
13141,with all its flaws 
13142,it may be a nobrainer  but at least it s a funny nobrainer  
13143,a terrific screenplay and fanciful direction 
13144,s what makes their project so interesting 
13145,got to love a disney pic with as little cleavage as this one has  and a heroine as feisty and principled as jane 
13146,adults  other than the parents  will be hard pressed to succumb to the call of the wild  
13147,s rare for any movie to be as subtle and touching as the son s room  
13148,intelligent  realistic portrayal 
13149,funnier than being about something 
13150,a film that is part biography  part entertainment and part history 
13151,all the way 
13152,is that rare combination of bad writing  bad direction and bad acting  the trifecta of badness  
13153,other feelgood fiascos like antwone fisher or 
13154,convincing way 
13155,into too many pointless situations 
13156, is so intimate and sensual and funny and psychologically selfrevealing that it makes most of what passes for sex in the movies look like cheap hysterics  
13157,a sentimental mess that never 
13158,the young stars are too cute  the story and ensuing complications are too manipulative  the message is too blatant  the resolutions are too convenient 
13159,stale retread of the 53 original 
13160,trial movie 
13161,starts making water torture seem appealing 
13162,is a canny crowd pleaser  and the last kiss  provides more than enough sentimental catharsis for a satisfying evening at the multiplex 
13163,the perkiness of witherspoon  who is always a joy to watch  even when her material is not firstrate  
13164,servicable world war ii drama 
13165,the beautifully choreographed kitchen ballet 
13166,rodrigues s 
13167,are too obvious 
13168,walked out muttering words like  horrible  and  terrible   but had so much fun dissing the film that they did nt mind the ticket cost 
13169,an accessible introduction as well as 
13170,an energetic  violent movie 
13171,than a more measured or polished production ever could 
13172,a stirring visual sequence like a surge through swirling rapids or a leap from pinnacle to pinnacle rouses us  
13173,s more enjoyable than i expected  though 
13174,wonderfully funny moments 
13175,i just saw this movie  well  it s probably not accurate to call it a movie 
13176,of fresh air 
13177, resistance and artistic transcendence 
13178,funny  sometimes hilarious  
13179,the tv movieesque  affected child acting to the dullest irish pub scenes ever filmed

13182,agenda to deliver aweinspiring  at times sublime  visuals 
13183,too indulgent

13198, an hourandahalf of inoffensive  unmemorable filler  
13199,as little cleavage 
13200,prolonged and boring 
13201,confrontations 
13202,fumbles away almost all of its accumulated enjoyment with a crucial third act miscalculation 
13203,the movie is concocted and carried out by folks worthy of scorn  and 
13204,a rather unique approach to documentary 
13205,like most of jaglom s films  some of it is honestly affecting  but more of it seems contrived and secondhand 
13206,this fascinating  and timely  content comes wrapped 
13207,s also nice to see a movie with its heart so thoroughly 
13208, improvised over many months  and for conveying the way tiny acts of kindness make ordinary life survivable 
13209,with a sensitivity

13211,capture the minds and hearts of many 
13212,offensive and redundant 
13213,caught up in the rush of slapstick thoroughfare 
13214,memorable directorial debut 
13215,do nt know why steven seagal is considered a star  nor why he keeps being cast in action films when none of them are ever any good or make any money  
13216,comes together to create a very compelling  sensitive  intelligent and almost cohesive piece of film entertainment 
13217,soulless 
13218,thinking someone made off with your wallet 
13219,an affluent damsel in distress who decides to fight her bully of a husband 
13220,the rich performances by friel  and especially williams  an american actress who becomes fully english  round out the square edges  
13221,dramatic enough to sustain interest 
13222,it s a very very strong  b    
13223,just enough sweet and traditional romantic comedy to counter the crudity 
13224,on the santa clause 2 
13225,if you are in the mood for an intelligent weepy  it can easily worm its way into your heart   
13226,despite juliet stevenon s attempt to bring cohesion to pamela s emotional roller coaster life  it is not enough to give the film the substance it so desperately needs  
13227,funny and

13229,the emotion or timelessness of disney s great past 
13230,its essential problem

13251,winning actresses  and one academy award winning actor  succumb to appearing in this junk that s tv sitcom material at best 
13252,skip this turd 
13253,thinking the only reason to make the movie is because present standards allow for plenty of nudity 
13254,every visual joke is milked  every setup obvious and lengthy  
13255,pretentious  
13256,coarse  cliched and clunky  this trifling romantic comedy in which opposites attract for no better reason than that the screenplay demands it squanders the charms of stars hugh grant and sandra bullock  
13257,a sham construct based on theory  sleightofhand  and illwrought hypothesis

13261,an ode to unconditional love and compassion garnered from years of seeing it all  a condition only the old are privy to  and  often misconstrued as weakness 
13262,gorgeous to look at but insufferably tedious and turgid  a curiously constricted epic 
13263,tom tykwer  director of the resonant and sensespinning run lola run 
13264,horribly depressing and not 
13265,a moving and weighty depiction of one family s attempts to heal after the death of a child  
13266,this quality band may pick up new admirers 
13267,demanding regular shocks and bouts of barely defensible sexual violence to keep it interested

13661,the cast  collectively a successful example of the lovableloser protagonist  
13662,film a must for everyone from junior scientists to grownup fish lovers 
13663,appropriately  the tale unfolds like a lazy summer afternoon and concludes with the crisp clarity of a fall dawn  
13664,a sweetly affecting story about four sisters who are coping  in one way or another  with life 
13665,very entertaining  thoughtprovoking film 
13666,to make absurdist observations 
13667,you were thinking someone made off with your wallet 
13668,at least passably real 
13669,as a twoway timeswitching myopic mystery that stalls in its lackluster gear of emotional blandness 
13670,with a script that prevents them from firing on all cylinders 
13671,for the quirky 
13672,real documentary 
13673,evelyn may be based on a true and historically significant story 
13674,expect from the guyinadress genre 
13675,whatever fills time  
13676,that illustrates why the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts in today s hollywood 
13677, this is even better than the fellowship  
13678,leave it to john sayles to take on developers  the chamber of commerce  tourism  historical pageants  and commercialism all in the same movie  without neglecting character development for even one minute  
13679,an occasionally interesting but mostly repetitive 
13680,at ninety minutes  it drags 
13681,cannon s confidence and laidback good spirits are  with the drumming routines  among the film s saving graces  
13682,like a featurelength sitcom replete with stereotypical familial quandaries 
13683,only had a week to live 
13684,love may have been in the air onscreen  but i certainly was nt feeling any of it  
13685,as one of  witherspoon s  better films 
13686, with increasingly amused irony  the relationship between reluctant captors and befuddled captives  
13687,an odd show 
13688,comfy 
13689,younger lad 
13690,see it for his performance if nothing else  
13691,lazily 
13692, true story  
13693,this sappy ethnic sleeper proves that not only blockbusters pollute the summer movie pool  
13694,familiar and insufficiently cathartic 
13695,the intrigue of academic skullduggery and politics 
13696,manipulative claptrap  
13697, just for them 
13698,interesting 
13699,if solondz had two ideas for two movies  could nt really figure out how to flesh either out 
13700,be delightfully compatible 
13701,a charmer 
13702,overachieving 
13703,adrenalin 
13704,is repulsive and depressing 
13705,to love the piano teacher 
13706,as stomachturning as the way adam sandler s new movie rapes 
13707,enough cool fun here 
13708,deserves a place of honor 
13709,give credit to everyone from robinson down to the key grip that this bold move works 
13710,leave you speaking in tongues 
13711,love in the time of money 
13712,look more like stereotypical caretakers and moral teachers  instead of serious athletes 
13713,to those who have not read the book  the film is a much better motherdaughter tale than last summer s  divine secrets of the yaya sisterhood   but that s not saying much  
13714,consider it  perfection  
13715,as a powerful look at a failure of our justice system 
13716,sees those relationships  including that between the son and his wife  and the wife and the father  and between the two brothers  with incredible subtlety and acumen 
13717,a more balanced or fair portrayal of both sides 
13718,fraction 
13719,it suits the script 
13720,moving and revelatory 
13721,a moving and not infrequently breathtaking film  
13722,i know better than to rush to the theater for this one 
13723,it belongs on the big screen 
13724,could force you to scratch a hole in your head  
13725,scenes brim 
13726,green ruins every single scene he s in  and the film  while it s not completely wreaked  is seriously compromised by that  
13727,landing squarely on  stupid  
13728,d be hard pressed to think of a film more cloyingly sappy than evelyn this year 
13729,backbone 
13730,hugely imaginative and successful 
13731,that proceeds 
13732,viewers out in the cold 
13733, er  bubbly 
13734,disguised as a war tribute is disgusting to begin with 
13735,far from heaven is a dazzling conceptual feat  but more than that  it s a work of enthralling drama 
13736,disposable  kitchensink homage that illustrates why the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts in today s hollywood 
13737, stumbles over every cheap trick in the book trying to make the outrage come even easier  
13738,s also nice 
13739,this unique and entertaining twist 
13740,you try to guess the order in which the kids in the house will be gored  
13741,become a historically significant work as well as a masterfully made one 
13742,the recording sessions are intriguing  and  on the way to striking a blow for artistic integrity  this quality band may pick up new admirers  
13743,s an adventure story and history lesson all in one 
13744,the film s needlessly opaque intro takes its doeeyed crudup out of pre9  11 new york and onto a crosscountry road trip of the homeric kind  
13745,is messy  uncouth  incomprehensible  vicious and absurd  
13746,equals the sum of its pretensions  
13747,by the standards of knucklehead swill 
13748,through putrid writing  direction and timing with a smile that says   if i stay positive  maybe i can channel one of my greatest pictures  drunken master   
13749,schaeffer s film never settles into the lightfooted enchantment the material needs  
13750,keep a family of five blind  crippled  amish people alive in this situation 
13751,greatest date movies 
13752,having an old friend 
13753,has the stuff to stand tall with pryor  carlin and murphy 
13754,certainly ca nt recommend it 
13755,not a classic 
13756,alias betty is richly detailed  deftly executed and utterly absorbing  
13757,this simple  sweet and romantic comedy 
13758,wastes an exceptionally good idea  
13759,that first made audiences on both sides of the atlantic love him 
13760,hélène angel is definitely a director to watch  
13761,many genuine cackles 
13762,a worthwhile documentary  whether you re into rap or not  even if it may still leave you wanting more answers as the credits roll  
13763,s as rude and profane as ever  always hilarious and  most of the time  absolutely right in her stinging social observations 
13764,while remaining true to his principles 
13765,just goes to show that if you give a filmmaker an unlimited amount of phony blood  nothing good can happen 
13766,memorable for a peculiar malaise that renders its tension 
13767,powerful rather than cloying 
13768,a screwedup man who dared to mess with some powerful people 
13769,turns out to be more interesting than any of the character dramas  which never reach satisfying conclusions 
13770,is exactly how genteel and unsurprising the execution turns out to be 
13771,glizty but formulaic and silly  cagney s  top of the world  has been replaced by the bottom of the barrel  
13772,intriguing  provocative stuff 
13773,heroine 
13774,hooked 
13775,clever enough to sustain a reasonable degree of suspense on its own 
13776,privy to 
13777,director lee has a true cinematic knack  but it s also nice to see a movie with its heart so thoroughly  unabashedly on its sleeve  
13778,the characters  who are so believable that you feel what they feel 
13779,collapses when mr taylor tries to shift the tone to a thriller s rush  
13780,our culture is headed down the toilet with the ferocity of a frozen burrito after an allnight tequila bender  and i know this because i ve seen  jackass  the movie   
13781,inexperienced 
13782,a florid but ultimately vapid crime melodrama 
13783,yes  i suppose it s lovely that cal works out his issues with his dad and comes to terms with his pictureperfect life  but world traveler gave me no reason to care  
13784,the rut dug by the last one 
13785,images and characters that were already tired 10 years ago 
13786,wang at the forefront of china s sixth generation of film makers 
13787,supremely unfunny and unentertaining 
13788,its best 
13789,an irrepressible passion 
13790,can be as tiresome as 9 seconds of jesse helms  anti castro rhetoric  which are included 
13791,a party worth attending 
13792,scorsese s bold images and generally smart casting 
13793,it s common knowledge that park and his founding partner  yong kang  lost kozmo in the end 
13794,hodgepodge 
13795,a sweettempered comedy that forgoes 
13796,parents beware 
13797,a bit of a downer and a little overdramatic at times 
13798,i walked away not really know who  they  were  what  they  looked like  
13799,finely detailed 
13800, reflective and beautifully 
13801,adaptation is simply brilliant  
13802,chase to end all chases 
13803,any enjoyment 
13804,if i stay positive 
13805,spent the past 20 minutes looking at your watch 
13806,this flat run at a hiphop tootsie is so poorly paced you could fit all of pootie tang in between its punchlines  
13807,the original hit movie 
13808,deserves more than a passing twinkle 
13809,how we all need a playful respite from the grind to refresh our souls 
13810,includes a fair share of dumb drug jokes and predictable slapstick 
13811,their recklessness 
13812,wellacted  welldirected and  for all its moodiness  not too 
13813,intelligence and 
13814,is completely lacking in charm and charisma  and is unable to project either esther s initial anomie or her eventual awakening  
13815,hard to resist 
13816,dahmer 
13817,workingclass subjects 
13818,right  from its promenade of barely clad bodies in myrtle beach  sc  to the adrenaline jolt of a sudden lunch rush at the diner

13820,go down in the annals of cinema as one of the great submarine stories 
13821,the lady and the duke represents the filmmaker s lifelong concern with formalist experimentation in cinematic art  
13822,a work of extraordinary journalism 
13823,de niro  
13824,a delightful  if minor  pastry of a movie  
13825,to the annoying score 
13826,if welles was unhappy at the prospect of the human race splitting in two  he probably would nt be too crazy with his greatgrandson s movie splitting up in pretty much the same way  
13827,is  arguably  the most accomplished work to date from hong kong s versatile stanley kwan 
13828,like a lowbudget hybrid of scarface or carlito s way 
13829,an engaging 
13830,is better than any summer blockbuster we had to endure last summer  and hopefully  sets the tone for a summer of good stuff 
13831,s something unintentionally comic in the film s drumbeat about authenticity  given the stale plot and pornographic way the film revels in swank apartments  clothes and parties  
13832,a strong and unforced supporting cast 
13833,delivered in grand passion 
13834,nolan s penetrating undercurrent 
13835,crack you up with her crass  then gasp for gas  verbal deportment 
13836,that the journey is such a mesmerizing one 
13837,s a movie that accomplishes so much that one viewing ca nt possibly be enough 
13838,it s burns  visuals  characters and his punchy dialogue  not his plot  that carry waydowntown  
13839,a thoughtful whatif 
13840,tough to watch 
13841,lots of laughs 
13842,is uncompromising  difficult and unbearably beautiful  
13843,the largeformat film is well suited to capture these musicians in full regalia and the incredible imax sound system lets you feel the beat down to your toes  
13844,it s an interesting effort  particularly for jfk conspiracy nuts   
13845,girls ca nt swim represents an engaging and intimate first feature by a talented director to watch  and it s a worthy entry in the french comingofage genre 
13846,the director treats us to an aimless hodgepodge 
13847,take us by surprise  
13848,a film of freshness  imagination and insight 
13849,rifkin no doubt fancies himself something of a hubert selby jr  but there is nt an ounce of honest poetry in his entire script 
13850,the story s pathetic 
13851,graphic sex may be what s attracting audiences to unfaithful  but gripping performances by lane and gere are what will keep them awake  
13852,utterly convincing  and deeply appealing  as a noble teacher who embraces a strict moral code 
13853,linking a halfwit plot to a series of standup routines in which wilson and murphy show how funny they could have been in a more ambitious movie 
13854,on a squirminducing fishoutofwater formula that goes nowhere and goes there very  very slowly 
13855,enriched by an imaginatively mixed cast of antic spirits  headed by christopher plummer as the subtlest and most complexly evil uncle ralph i ve ever seen in the many film 
13856,already obscure 
13857,toback s  fondness for fancy splitscreen  stuttering editing and pompous references to wittgenstein and kirkegaard 
13858,thrill you  touch you and 
13859,it falls far short of poetry 
13860,egodestroying 
13861,the jokes are sophomoric 
13862,a scummy ripoff of david cronenberg s brilliant  videodrome  
13863,even more reassuring is how its makers actually seem to understand what made allen s romantic comedies so pertinent and enduring 
13864,love him 
13865,sweet  genuine 
13866, it can easily worm its way into your heart   
13867,similar obsessions can dominate a family 
13868,advancing 
13869,the right direction 
13870,this is a movie that refreshes the mind and spirit along with the body  so original is its content  look  and style

13872,fits 
13873,the young actors  not very experienced  
13874, dancing  singing  and unforgettable characters 
13875,loved the people onscreen  
13876,appear foolish and shallow 
13877, comes alive only when it switches gears to the sentimental  
13878,firstclass  natural acting and a look at  the real americans  make this a charmer  
13879,fairly lame 
13880,rewritten  and for the uncompromising knowledge that the highest power of all is the power of love  
13881,of this and that  whatever fills time  with no unified whole 
13882, oddly colorful and just plain otherworldly 
13883,d have to be a most hardhearted person not to be moved by this drama 
13884,breaks its little neck trying to perform entertaining tricks 
13885,overly convenient 
13886,the success of undercover brother 
13887,loosely speaking  we re in all of me territory again  
13888,they fall to pieces 
13889,pseudointellectual kid 
13890,releasing a film with the word  dog  in its title in january lends itself to easy jokes and insults  
13891,a funny yet dark and seedy clash of cultures and generations  
13892,assured direction and complete lack of modern day irony 
13893,of funny situations and honest observations 
13894,certainly clever in spots 
13895,your ego 
13896,it s coherent  well shot  and tartly acted 
13897,holland lets things peter out midway  but it s notably better acted  and far less crass  than some other recent efforts in the burgeoning genre of films about black urban professionals  
13898,ice age is consistently amusing and engrossing  
13899,soapopera emotion 
13900,in its perfect quiet pace 
13901,this is one of the year s best films  
13902,it s uninteresting  
13903,a film that s about as subtle as a party political broadcast 
13904,it s an entertaining movie  and the effects  boosted to the size of a downtown hotel  will all but take you to outer space  
13905,not invite some genuine spontaneity into the film by having the evil aliens  laser guns actually hit something for once  
13906,emotional and moral 
13907,very ambitious project 
13908, it is clearly a good thing  
13909,superbly acted offbeat thriller 
13910,add up to little more than a screenful of gamesmanship that s low on both suspense and payoff  
13911,looks to be going through the motions  beginning with the pale script  
13912, more inadvertent ones and stunningly trite 
13913,shows how deeply felt emotions can draw people together across the walls that might otherwise separate them  
13914,is nt as weird as it ought to be 
13915,incredibly flexible 
13916,catonjones 
13917,a surprising  subtle turn 
13918,that carries its share of laughs  sometimes a chuckle  sometimes a guffaw and  to my great pleasure  the occasional belly laugh 
13919,whose charm  cultivation and devotion to his people are readily apparent 
13920,nice 
13921,luscious 
13922,this 65minute trifle 
13923,insultingly inept and artificial 
13924,a thoroughly enjoyable  heartfelt comingofage comedy  
13925,trailertrash style 
13926,a slapdash mess 
13927,watchable up 
13928,stay away 
13929,manages just to be depressing  as the lead actor phones in his autobiographical performance  
13930,thinking about how good it all was  and started doing nothing but reacting to it  feeling a part of its grand locations  thinking urgently as the protagonists struggled  feeling at the mercy of its inventiveness  gasping at its visual delights 
13931,that the debate it joins is a necessary and timely one 
13932,invite some genuine spontaneity into the film by having the evil aliens  laser guns actually hit something for once 
13933,full flush 
13934,eventually pays off and is effective if you stick with it 
13935,the buoyant energy level of the film s city beginnings 
13936,ghandi gone bad 
13937,is astonishing 
13938,the first movie 
13939,to include every topnotch british actor who did not appear in gosford park  as well as one  ms mirren  who did  
13940,french malapropisms 
13941,might actually want to watch  
13942,necessary to document all this emotional misery 
13943,is simply no doubt that this film asks the right questions at the right time in the history of our country 
13944,concentrating on the elements of a revealing alienation among a culture of people who sadly are at hostile odds with one another through recklessness and retaliation 
13945,recommended  as visually bland as a dentist s waiting room  complete with soothing muzak and 
13946,a moving and weighty depiction 
13947,a noholdsbarred cinematic 
13948,knows how to hold the screen 
13949, die another day  one of the most entertaining bonds in years 
13950,a worthwhile addition 
13951,with restraint and a delicate ambiguity 
13952,characters who are either too goodly  wise and knowing or downright comically evil 
13953,film school undergrad 
13954,a cellular phone commercial 
13955,i m sure there s a teenage boy out there somewhere who s dying for this kind of entertainment  
13956,there are too many bona fide groaners among too few laughs 
13957,will indeed sit openmouthed before the screen  not screaming but yawning 
13958,return ticket 
13959,to feel funny and light 
13960,the ambiguous welcome extended by iran to the afghani refugees who streamed across its borders  desperate for work and food 
13961,alienation 
13962,spectators will indeed sit openmouthed before the screen  not screaming but yawning  
13963,an extremely funny  ultimately heartbreaking look at life in contemporary china  
13964,ve completely 
13965,loses its overall sense of mystery and 
13966,enough flourishes and freakouts 
13967,lack any intrigue  other than their funny accents  
13968,the importance of being earnest movie seems to be missing a great deal of the acerbic repartee of the play   
13969,s a testament to the film s considerable charm 
13970,flatout amusing  sometimes endearing and 
13971,fascinating little thriller 
13972,s the brilliant surfing photography bringing you right inside the massive waves that lifts blue crush into one of the summer s most pleasurable movies  
13973,quietly vulnerable 
13974,inauthentic 
13975,mental illness 
13976,is weak  
13977,the exuberant openness 
13978,but it makes for one of the most purely enjoyable and satisfying evenings at the movies i ve had in a while  
13979,gag 
13980,is the director s talent 
13981,for all the time we spend with these people  we never really get inside of them  
13982,is all about a wildandwoolly  walltowall good time  
13983,it s a rushed  slapdash  sequelforthesake  ofasequel with less than half 
13984,lacks aspirations of social upheaval  
13985, less a movie than  an appalling  odoriferous thing  so rotten in almost every single facet of production that you ll want to crawl up your own  in embarrassment  
13986,becomes lifeless 
13987,any viewer forced to watch him try out so many complicated facial expressions 
13988,on  stupid 
13989,is about as humorous as watching your favorite pet get buried alive  
13990,s usually a bad sign when directors abandon their scripts and go where the moment takes them 
13991,if sm seems like a strange route to true love  maybe it is  but it s to this film s  and its makers   credit that we believe that that s exactly what these two people need to find each other  and themselves  
13992,its makers are nt removed and inquisitive enough for that 
13993,killing time  that s all that s going on here  
13994,go back to sleep  
13995,does nt necessarily equate to being good  no matter how admirably the filmmakers have gone for broke 
13996,the fluid motion is astounding on any number of levels 
13997,mindnumbingly awful that you hope britney wo nt do it one more time  as far as 
13998,at your neighbor s garage sale 
13999,everyone s to blame here  
14000,cut open a vein 
14001,into a grossout monster movie with effects that are more silly than scary 
14002,true to its animatronic roots   as stiff  ponderous and charmless as a mechanical apparatus   the country bears  should never have been brought out of hibernation  
14003,bubba hotep s clearly evident quality 
14004,win any academy awards 
14005,awkwardly paced 
14006,whatever satire lucky break was aiming for  it certainly got lost in the  soontobeforgettable  section of the quirky ripoff prison romp pile  
14007, debut can be accused of being a bit undisciplined 
14008,this movie worth seeing 
14009,wryly amusing 
14010,evokes a palpable sense of disconnection  made all the more poignant by the incessant use of cell phones  
14011,more complex 
14012,balances both traditional or modern stories 
14013,progresses in such a lowkey manner that it risks monotony 
14014,joshua is as blasphemous and nonsensical as a luis buñuel film without the latter s attendant intelligence  poetry  passion  and genius  
14015,hastily dubbed 
14016,an accessible introduction as well as some intelligent observations on the success of bollywood 
14017,captures the moment when a woman s life  out of a deepseated  emotional need  is about to turn onto a different path 
14018,proved too difficult a text to  lick   despite the efforts of a firstrate cast  
14019,this insipid  brutally clueless film

14021,the disjointed mess

14023,is just garbage 
14024,could have been much better 
14025,may strain adult credibility 
14026,bad acting 
14027,an often intense character study about fathers and sons  loyalty and duty 
14028,a riot 
14029,pays off  as does its sensitive handling of some delicate subject matter 
14030,as tiresome as 9 seconds of jesse helms  anti castro 
14031,despite the opulent lushness of every scene 
14032,another best 
14033,comes off as a kingdom more mild than wild  
14034,comical 
14035,thinlyconceived movie  
14036,re going to feel like you were nt invited to the party  
14037,maggie g makes an amazing breakthrough in her first starring role and eats up the screen  
14038,a clichéd and shallow cautionary tale about the hardpartying lives of gay men  
14039,gorgeous  passionate  and at times uncommonly moving 
14040,of observation in the work of the director  frank novak  that keeps the film grounded in an undeniable social realism 
14041,hollywood too long has ignored 
14042,overlong and not wellacted  but credit writerproducerdirector

14837,has all the same problems the majority of action comedies have 
14838,one of the best films of the year with its exquisite acting  inventive screenplay  mesmerizing music  and many inimitable scenes 
14839,of the cleverest  most deceptively amusing comedies of the year 
14840,through its hackneyed elements 
14841,sketchy but nevertheless 
14842,bracing 
14843,offering next to little insight into its intriguing subject 
14844,benefits from serendipity but also reminds us of our own responsibility to question what is told as the truth 
14845,labors as storytelling  
14846,understands how to create and sustain a mood 
14847,an enthralling  
14848,hailed 
14849,a gorgeous pair 
14850,farflung  illogical 
14851,from its nauseating spinning credits sequence to a very talented but underutilized supporting cast 
14852,flavorless 
14853,the addition of a wholly unnecessary precredit sequence designed to give some of the characters a  back story 
14854,particularly joyless  and exceedingly dull  
14855,at once laughable 
14856,a successful career in tv 
14857,evolved from star to superstar 
14858,is still able to create an engaging story that keeps you guessing at almost every turn  
14859,animated drivel 
14860,the rest of us will be lulled into a coma  
14861,no wit  
14862, much about the film  including some of its casting  is frustratingly unconvincing  
14863,like a particularly amateurish episode of bewitched that takes place during spring break 
14864,a bmovie you can sit through  enjoy on a certain level and then forget  
14865,a remarkable piece of filmmaking 
14866,be very sweet indeed 
14867,applies more detail to the film s music than to the story line 
14868,uncanny

14870,dumb gags  
14871,s too long 
14872,loved the people onscreen  even though i could not stand them

14874,the past 20 minutes looking at your watch 
14875,have ransacked every old world war ii movie for overly familiar material 
14876,is a film that takes a stand in favor of tradition and warmth  
14877,as bad 
14878,something vital 
14879,style massacres erupt throughout 
14880,full of holes and completely lacking in chills 
14881,come to term an  ambitious failure 
14882,its share of belly laughs  including a knockout of a closing line  
14883,the greatest films 
14884,is sure to give you a lot of laughs in this simple  sweet and romantic comedy  
14885,to sit back and enjoy a couple of great actors hamming it up 
14886,assume the director has pictures of them cavorting in ladies  underwear 
14887,strange occurrences build in the mind of the viewer and take on extreme urgency

14894,of beautiful movement and inside information 
14895,while not quite  shrek  or  monsters  inc   it s not too bad  
14896,the cumulative effect of watching this 65minute trifle is rather like being trapped while some weird relative trots out the video he took of the family vacation to stonehenge  
14897,stupid 
14898,it s an entertaining movie  
14899, the first 23 of the film are incredibly captivating and insanely funny  thanks in part to interesting cinematic devices  cool visual backmasking   a solid cast  and some wickedly sick and twisted humor  
14900,silly stuff  all mixed up together like a term paper from a kid who ca nt quite distinguish one scifi work from another 
14901,the old boy s characters more quickwitted than any english lit 
14902,tight and nasty 
14903,modernizes aew mason s story to suit the sensibilities of a young american  a decision that plucks  the four feathers  bare  
14904,john hughes comedy 
14905,that you enjoy more because you re one of the lucky few who sought it out 
14906,is a clever and cutting  quick and dirty look at modern living and movie life  
14907,literary desecrations 
14908,horribly depressing and not very well done 
14909,evergrowing category 
14910,emerges in the movie  using a plot that could have come from an animatedmovie screenwriting textbook 
14911,got just enough charm and appealing character quirks to forgive that still serious problem 
14912,maybe because it echoes the by now intolerable morbidity of so many recent movies 
14913, groan and hiss 
14914,tries to be smart 
14915,uses the website feardotcomcom or the improperly hammy performance from poor stephen rea 
14916,like a fish that s lived too long  austin powers in goldmember has some unnecessary parts and is kinda wrong in places  
14917,too clichéd 
14918,generate the belly laughs of lowbrow comedy without sacrificing its highminded appeal 
14919,does justice both to stevenson and to the scifi genre  
14920,what a film can be 
14921,sweettempered comedy 
14922,relegated to the background  a welcome step 
14923,it desperately wants to be a wacky  screwball comedy  but the most screwy thing here is how so many talented people were convinced to waste their time 
14924,after next is the kind of film that could only be made by africanamericans because of its broad racial insensitivity towards africanamericans  
14925,the film s highlight 
14926,outside the under10 set 
14927,is deeply concerned with morality 
14928,his penchant for tearing up on cue  things that seem so real in small doses 
14929,naipaul original 
14930,full of itself 
14931, storytelling fails to provide much more insight than the inside column of a torn book jacket  
14932,of a good time for both children and parents 
14933,avoids all the comic possibilities of its situation  and 
14934,ca nt seem to get a coherent rhythm going 
14935, songs from the second floor has all the enjoyable randomness of a very lively dream and so manages to be compelling  amusing and unsettling at the same time  
14936,a strong dramatic and emotional pull that gradually sneaks up on the audience 
14937,sudsy 
14938,some kid who ca nt act  only 
14939, or  suck  
14940,crisper and 
14941,be wholesome and subversive at the same time 
14942,lost in the  soontobeforgettable  section of the quirky ripoff prison 
14943,solondz may be convinced that he has something significant to say  but 
14944,a strong directorial stamp 
14945,although what time offers tsai s usual style and themes  it has a more colorful  more playful tone than his other films  
14946,sooooo tired 
14947,the thrill of the chill 
14948,an oddly fascinating depiction of an architect of pop culture 
14949,imagine having more fun watching a documentary 
14950,a compelling french psychological drama examining the encounter of an aloof father and his chilly son after 20 years apart 
14951,blade ii is still topheavy with blazing guns  cheatfully filmed martial arts  disintegrating bloodsucker computer effects and jagged camera moves that serve no other purpose than to call attention to themselves  
14952, de niro and murphy make showtime the most savory and hilarious guilty pleasure of many a recent movie season  
14953,best movies 
14954,but this time  the old mib label stands for milder is nt better  
14955,is simple but absorbing 
14956,victor rosa is leguizamo s best movie work so far  a subtle and richly internalized performance

14963,poignant and moving  a walk to remember is an inspirational love story  capturing the innocence and idealism of that first encounter  
14964,cared much about any aspect of it  from its cheesy screenplay to the grayish quality of its lighting to its lastminute  haphazard theatrical release

14988,the scorpion king more than ably meets those standards 
14989,woven together skilfully 
14990,the bigscreen scooby 
14991,is uniquely felt with a sardonic jolt 
14992,there s nothing more satisfying during a summer of event movies than a spy thriller like the bourne identity that s packed with just as much intelligence as action  
14993,s just too bad the screenwriters eventually shoot themselves in the feet with cop flick cliches like an oily arms dealer  squad car pileups and the requisite screaming captain 
14994,the film s trailer also looked like crap  so crap is what i was expecting  
14995,unlikable  uninteresting  unfunny 
14996,descends into such messagemongering moralism that its good qualities are obscured 
14997,captures the way young japanese live now  chafing against their culture s manic mix of millennial brusqueness and undying  traditional politesse

15001,are canny and spiced with irony 
15002,the charm of the first movie 
15003,well made but uninvolving  bloodwork is nt a terrible movie  just a stultifyingly obvious one  an unrewarding collar for a murder mystery  
15004,a core of flimsy  or  worse yet  nonexistent  ideas 
15005,a dazzling conceptual feat 
15006,even leaves you with a few lingering animated thoughts 
15007,it goes by quickly  because it has some of the funniest jokes of any movie this year  including those intended for adults 
15008,an enthralling  entertaining feature  
15009,drive past  even if it chiefly inspires you to drive a little faster 
15010,sour attempt 
15011,the obnoxious special effects  the obligatory outbursts of flatulence and the incessant  sofiveminutesago pop music on the soundtrack overwhelm what is left of the scruffy  dopey old hannabarbera charm  
15012,this slight premise 
15013,a moving and solidly entertaining comedydrama 
15014,a smart  provocative drama that does the nearly impossible 
15015,as good as the original 
15016,sex and lucia is so alluring 
15017,with often surprising twists and an intermingling of naiveté and sophistication 
15018,succumbs to sensationalism 
15019,i ca nt see why any actor of talent would ever work in a mcculloch production again if they looked at how this movie turned out  
15020,south park 
15021,that serve no other purpose than to call attention to themselves 
15022,a charming but slight comedy 
15023,woefully pretentious  
15024,peppered with false starts and populated by characters who are nearly impossible to care about 
15025,is entertainment opportunism at its most glaring 
15026,disappointing 
15027,the movie is a mess from start to finish  
15028,monotone narration

15036,loves its characters and communicates something rather beautiful 
15037,ache with sadness  the way chekhov is funny   profound without ever being selfimportant 
15038,the charm of kevin kline and 
15039,it s all quite tasteful to look at 
15040,equal laughs 
15041,would be a lot better if it pared down its plots and characters to a few rather than dozens  or if it were subtler  or if it had a sense of humor 
15042,a bid to hold our attention 
15043,a movie that grips and holds you in rapt attention from

15057,boobs 
15058,its creator s comic voice 
15059,that have become a spielberg trademark

15061,is a distinct rarity  and an event  
15062,sumptuous ocean visuals and the cinematic stylings of director john stockwell 
15063,which is paperthin and decidedly unoriginal 
15064,a beautiful  entertaining two hours 
15065,astonishing is nt the word  neither is incompetent  incoherent or just plain crap  
15066,lasting traces 
15067, digs beyond the usual portrayals of good kids and bad seeds to reveal a more ambivalent set of characters and motivations  
15068,s just too dry and too placid

15072,too much meandering  norton has to recite bland police procedural details  fiennes wanders around in an attempt to seem weird and distanced  hopkins looks like a drag queen

15074,stomach so much tongueincheek weirdness 
15075,smarter 
15076,bring off this wild welsh whimsy  
15077,becomes just another voyeuristic spectacle

15080,given it a onestar rating 
15081,ruthlessly pained 
15082,never settles into the lightfooted enchantment the material needs 
15083,is exactly what it wants to be  an atrociously  mindnumbingly  indescribably bad movie 
15084,worth a look for its truetolife characters  its sensitive acting  its unadorned view of rural life and the subtle direction of firsttimer hilary birmingham 
15085,expands the limits of what a film can be  taking us into the lives of women to whom we might not give a second look if we passed them on the street  
15086,will attach a human face to all those little steaming cartons  
15087,pull it back 
15088,a bracing  unblinking work that serves as a painful elegy and sobering cautionary tale  
15089,almost every single facet of production 
15090,the acting  for the most part  is terrific  although the actors must struggle with the fact that they re playing characters who sometimes feel more like literary conceits than fleshandblood humans  
15091,psychologically savvy 
15092, some of it is honestly affecting 
15093,victim to sloppy plotting 
15094,a sundrenched masterpiece  part parlor game  part psychological case study  part droll social satire

15116,a terrific date movie 
15117,smart  sassy 
15118,seems impossible that an epic fourhour indian musical about a cricket game could be this good 
15119,is definitely worth seeing 
15120,an even more predictable  clicheridden endeavor than its predecessor  
15121,is one baaaaaaaaad movie

15123,texture and realism 
15124,the story really has no place to go since simone is not real 
15125,ca nt quite live up to it 
15126,finds its moviegoing pleasures in the tiny events that could make a person who has lived her life halfasleep suddenly wake up and take notice 
15127,while the transgressive trappings  especially the frank sex scenes  ensure that the film is never dull  rodrigues s beastwithin metaphor is ultimately rather silly and overwrought  making the ambiguous ending seem goofy rather than provocative  
15128,acting horribly 
15129,allnight 
15130,will have been discovered  indulged in and rejected as boring before i see this piece of crap again  
15131,is just such an achievement 
15132,almost everyone growing up believes their family must look like  the addams family  to everyone looking in   my big fat greek wedding  comes from the heart  
15133,s truly deserving of its oscar nomination 
15134,most depressing 
15135,could have turned this into an argentine retread of  iris  or  american beauty   but instead pulls a little from each film and creates something more beautiful than either of those films  
15136,a fish that s lived too long 
15137,the small  human moments 
15138,of the tooth and claw of human power 
15139,a gentle waking coma 
15140,although i did nt hate this one  it s not very good either  
15141,paved with good intentions leads to the video store  
15142,one of the more glaring signs of this movie s servitude to its superstar is the way it skirts around any scenes that might have required genuine acting from ms spears  
15143,the same way goodall did  with a serious minded patience  respect and affection 
15144,is a real charmer  
15145,the word that comes to mind  while watching eric rohmer s tribute to a courageous scottish lady 
15146,like the work of an artist who is simply tired  of fighting the same fights  of putting the weight of the world on his shoulders  of playing with narrative form  
15147,opposites attract for no better reason than that the screenplay demands it 
15148,the bottom tier

15191,make showtime the most savory and hilarious guilty pleasure of many a recent movie season  
15192,an actual vietnam war combat movie

15204,suffocate the illumination created by the two daughters

15206,would make it a great piece to watch with kids and use to introduce video as art 
15207,enhances the personal touch of manual animation 
15208,give it a marginal thumbs up 
15209,the film feels uncomfortably real  its language and locations bearing the unmistakable stamp of authority  
15210,s easier to change the sheets than to change hackneyed concepts when it comes to dreaming up romantic comedies

15226,the sick sense

15241,a 75minute sample of puerile rubbish that is listless  witless  and devoid of anything resembling humor  
15242,often surprising twists and an intermingling of naiveté and sophistication 
15243,attal s hangups surrounding infidelity are so oldfashioned and  dare i say  outdated

15423,yet  it still works  
15424,has at last decisively broken with her friends image in an independent film of satiric fire and emotional turmoil 
15425,a prolonged extrusion of psychopathic pulp 
15426,extends to his supple understanding of the role that brown played in american culture as an athlete  a movie star  and an image of black indomitability

15429,yet depressing 
15430,time to congratulate himself for having the guts to confront it 
15431,is a lot like a wellmade pb  j sandwich  familiar  fairly uneventful and boasting no real surprises  but still quite tasty and inviting all the same

15433,expected it to be 
15434,need to try very hard 
15435,benevolent deception  which  while it may not rival the filmmaker s period pieces  is still very much worth seeing 
15436,talented enough and charismatic enough to make us care about zelda s ultimate fate 
15437,gets drawn into the party  
15438,just dreadful 
15439,lush and beautifully photographed  somebody suggested the stills might make a nice coffee table book  
15440,does her best 
15441,both shrill and soporific  and because everything is repeated five or six times  it can seem tiresomely simpleminded  
15442,a lot of stamina and vitality 
15443,it s too harsh to work as a piece of storytelling  but 
15444,as the scruffy sands of its titular community 
15445,seeing himself in the other  
15446,evacuations  and nonetoofunny commentary on the cultural distinctions between americans and brits 
15447,premise  mopes through a dreary tract of virtually plotless meanderings and then ends with a whimper 
15448,does nt really care about the thousands of americans who die hideously 
15449,its ability to shock and amaze 
15450,make jk rowling s marvelous series into a deadly bore 
15451,quite a comedy nor 
15452,of lazy tearjerker that gives movies about ordinary folk a bad name 
15453,a moving tale of love and destruction in unexpected places 
15454,cleverly constructed scenario 
15455,consumed by lust and love 
15456,has all the same problems the majority of action comedies have  
15457,unoriginal run 
15458, it traps audiences in a series of relentlessly nasty situations that we would pay a considerable ransom not to be looking at  
15459,fascinating documentary 
15460,gloriously flippant as lock  stock and two smoking barrels 
15461, often hilarious romantic jealousy comedy 
15462,is a good one 
15463,it s also not smart or barbed enough for older viewers 
15464,an annoying orgy of excess and exploitation 
15465,a film that suffers because of its many excesses  
15466,a vibrant whirlwind of love  family and all that goes with it  my big fat greek wedding is a nonstop funny feast of warmth  color and cringe  
15467,is no psychology here  and no real narrative logic  just a series of carefully choreographed atrocities  which become strangely impersonal and abstract  
15468,was created for the nonfan to figure out what makes wilco a big deal 
15469,nothing more or less than an outright bodiceripper  it should have ditched the artsy pretensions and revelled in the entertaining shallows  
15470,the end result is like cold porridge with only the odd enjoyably chewy lump  
15471,of the best looking and stylish 
15472,little fuss or noise 
15473,like a change in  herzog s  personal policy than a halfhearted fluke  
15474,a movie that accomplishes so much that one viewing ca nt possibly be enough 
15475,visual hideousness 
15476,a decomposition of healthy eccentric inspiration and ambition 
15477,who manages to blast even the smallest sensitivities from the romance with his clamorous approach 
15478,the film fits into a genre that has been overexposed  redolent of a thousand cliches  and yet remains uniquely itself  vibrant with originality  
15479,leave the auditorium feeling dizzy  confused  and totally disorientated 
15480,of youarethere immediacy 
15481,sterling ensemble cast 
15482,a charming  banterfilled comedy  one of those airy cinematic bon bons whose aims  and by extension  accomplishments  seem deceptively slight on the surface  
15483,reno himself can take credit for most of the movie s success  
15484,up as tedious as the chatter of parrots raised on oprah 
15485,has usually 
15486,show a remarkable ability to document both sides of this emotional carwreck  
15487,s apparently been forced by his kids to watch too many barney videos 
15488,holocaust escape story 
15489,seagal is painfully foolish in trying to hold onto what s left of his passe  chopsocky glory  
15490,a good yarn 
15491,more of a poetic than a strict reality  creating an intriguing species of artifice that gives the lady and the duke something of a theatrical air 
15492, the effect comes off as selfparody  
15493,it counts heart as important as humor 
15494,a touching drama about old age and grief 
15495,lacks balance  and fails to put the struggle into meaningful historical context 
15496,too loud  too goofy and too short 
15497,it s  worth the extra effort to see an artist  still committed to growth in his ninth decade  change while remaining true to his principles with a film whose very subject is  quite pointedly  about the peril of such efforts  
15498,work as shallow entertainment  not remotely incisive enough to qualify as drama  monsoon 
15499,the precedent of yiddish theater  whose jolly  funforfun s  sake communal spirit goes to the essence of broadway 
15500,a rather toothless take 
15501,it challenges  this nervy oddity  like modern art should  
15502,addition to hoffman s powerful acting clinic 
15503,does a disservice to the audience and to the genre 
15504,there s undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references  but the fun wears thin  then out  when there s nothing else happening  
15505,treats us to an aimless hodgepodge 
15506,of why the dv revolution has cheapened the artistry of making a film 
15507,picked me up  swung me around  and dropped me back in my seat with more emotional force than any other recent film 
15508,a film that hews out a world and carries us effortlessly from darkness to light 
15509,is surprisingly refreshing 
15510,is a goodhearted ensemble comedy with a variety of quirky characters and an engaging story 
15511,can analyze this movie in three words  thumbs friggin  down 
15512,laughs at how clever it s being  
15513,about issues most adults have to face in marriage 
15514,a coherent rhythm going 
15515,a worthy entry in the french comingofage genre

15518,oneofakind work 
15519,happy hour 
15520,s a frightful vanity film that  no doubt  pays off what debt miramax felt they owed to benigni  
15521,a memorable experience that  like many of his works  presents weighty issues 
15522,could have been crisper and punchier  
15523,sets out with no pretensions and delivers big time 
15524,the cinematic equivalent of high humidity 
15525,completely honest  openhearted film 
15526,take notice 
15527, clooney s  debut can be accused of being a bit undisciplined  but it has a tremendous  offbeat sense of style and humor that suggests he was influenced by some of the filmmakers who have directed him  especially the coen brothers and steven soderbergh  
15528,plays like a student film by two guys who desperately want to be quentin tarantino when they grow up 
15529, t  he film is never sure to make a clear point  even if it seeks to rely on an ambiguous presentation  
15530,the intentionally low standards 
15531,as often imaginative 
15532,those willing to endure its extremely languorous rhythms  waiting for happiness 
15533,a number of other assets to commend it to movie audiences both innocent and jaded 
15534,laziest 
15535,a trueblue delight  
15536,writerdirector ritchie reduces wertmuller s social mores and politics to tiresome jargon  
15537,marks a return to form for director peter bogdanovich 
15538,are just actory concoctions  defined by childlike dimness and a handful of quirks 
15539,s going to make a splash even greater than arnold schwarzenegger  jeanclaud van damme or steven segal 
15540,overrides what little we learn along the way about vicarious redemption 
15541,fresh  entertaining comedy 
15542,with all its flaws  is that it has none of the pushiness and decibel volume of most contemporary comedies  
15543,never change  
15544,with an intimate feeling  a saga of the ups and downs of friendships 
15545,will have a great time 
15546, slap her is a small but rewarding comedy that takes aim at contemporary southern adolescence and never lets up  
15547,intelligent 
15548,s about as overbearing and overthetop as the family 
15549,candy and cheeky wit to keep parents away from the concession stand 
15550,the lack of naturalness makes everything seem selfconsciously poetic and forced  
15551,backstabbing  interracial desire 
15552,are nowhere near 
15553,ended up in a movie this bad 
15554,somewhere along the way k19 jettisoned some crucial drama  
15555,a weirdly beautiful place 
15556,offers an interesting look at the rapidly changing face of beijing  
15557,the movie is so clumsily sentimental and ineptly directed it may leave you speaking in tongues  
15558,i liked about schmidt a lot  
15559,does nt work as either  
15560,lowbudget affair 
15561,that comes to mind  while watching eric rohmer s tribute to a courageous scottish lady 
15562,unaware 
15563,contrived situations 
15564,have the necessary selfcontrol to guide a loose  poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy 
15565,spy action flick with antonio banderas and lucy liu never comes together  
15566,surehanded direction 
15567,very slow  uneventful 
15568,in short  is nt nearly as funny as it thinks it is 
15569,trouble every day is a success in some sense  but it s hard to like a film so cold and dead  
15570,style and mystification 
15571,skunk 
15572,brosnan s finest nonbondish performance yet fails to overcome the film s manipulative sentimentality and annoying stereotypes  
15573,forget the psychology 101 study of romantic obsession and just watch the procession of costumes in castles and this wo nt seem like such a bore  
15574,sophisticated and 
15575,an entertaining  if ultimately minor  thriller  
15576,in a more ambitious movie 
15577,cliched dialogue 
15578,the dialogue is very choppy and monosyllabic despite the fact that it is being dubbed  
15579,less funny than it should be and less funny than it thinks it is 
15580,is nt nearly as funny 
15581,humorous and 
15582,her considerable talents 
15583,lawrence sounds whiny and defensive  as if his lifealtering experiences made him bitter and less mature  
15584,purports to be a hollywood satire but winds up as the kind of film that should be the target of something deeper and more engaging  
15585,is barely an hour long  
15586,riveted 
15587,muck 
15588,a far bigger  far more meaningful story 
15589,a complex psychological drama 
15590,the transporter bombards the viewer with so many explosions and 
15591,all excited about a chocolate eclair 
15592,will be lulled into a coma  
15593,dumb  narratively chaotic 
15594,a sense of real magic  perhaps  
15595,breathtaking  aweinspiring visual poetry 
15596,gaining most of its unsettling force 
15597,deadend distaste 
15598,wonderfully 
15599,this illconceived and expensive project 
15600,cross between xxx and vertical limit  
15601,funny  subtle  and resonant 
15602,exhausted 
15603,of movie that leaves vague impressions and a nasty aftertaste but little clear memory of its operational mechanics 
15604,thin stretched over the nearly 80minute running time 
15605,invulnerable as its trademark villain 
15606,is about something very interesting and odd that

15613,a dreadful day in irish history 
15614,conceive of anyone who has reached puberty actually finding the characters in slackers or their antics amusing  let alone funny 
15615,it is an unstinting look at a collaboration between damaged people that may or may not qual 
15616,worked better as a onehour tv documentary 
15617,is a fast  frenetic  funny  even punny 6  aimed specifically at a gradeschool audience 
15618,that plays like a bad soap opera  with passable performances from everyone in the cast 
15619,the ideas tie together beautifully 
15620,quite a nosedive 
15621,the film is filled with humorous observations about the general absurdity of modern life as seen through the eyes outsiders  but 
15622,a splendid meal 
15623,has stepped into the mainstream of filmmaking with an assurance worthy of international acclaim and with every cinematic tool well under his control  driven by a natural sense for what works on screen 
15624,is a gem 
15625,bad in a major movie 
15626,come away with a greater knowledge of the facts of cuban music 
15627, it s one of the worst of the entire franchise  
15628,i m not sure which half of dragonfly is worse  the part where nothing s happening  or the part where something s happening  but 
15629,you ve already seen city by the sea under a variety of titles  but 
15630,hilarious 
15631,all seemed wasted like deniro s once promising career and the once grand long beach boardwalk  
15632, light treat 
15633,also is more fully an example of the kind of lush  allenveloping movie experience it rhapsodizes 
15634,its lack of purpose 
15635,adolescents will be adequately served by the movie s sophomoric blend of shenanigans and slapstick  although the more lasciviousminded might be disappointed in the relative modesty of a movie that sports a  topless tutorial service   
15636,places the goodtime shenanigans in welcome perspective 
15637,a selection of scenes in search of a movie 
15638,less than the sum of its underventilated pèrefils confrontations 
15639,meshes in this elegant entertainment 
15640,re burnt out on it s a wonderful life marathons and bored with a christmas carol 
15641,promising 
15642,seems as though it was written for no one  but somehow 
15643,the alltoofamiliar dramatic arc 
15644,anchored by splendid performances 
15645,just a bunch of good actors 
15646,of attraction and interdependence 
15647,what starts off as a potentially incredibly twisting mystery becomes simply a monster chase film  
15648,the gorgeously elaborate continuation 
15649,fuses the events of her life with the imagery in her paintings so vividly that the artist s work may take on a striking new significance for anyone who sees the film  
15650,else who may  for whatever reason  be thinking about going to see this movie 
15651,is remarkably engaging despite being noticeably derivative of goodfellas and at least a half dozen other troubleintheghetto flicks 
15652,mundane 
15653,sinister happy ending 
15654,all its visual panache and compelling supporting characters 
15655,a hilarious place to visit 
15656,the engaging  
15657,entertaining comedy 
15658,britney spears  phoniness 
15659,it reduces the complexities to bromides and slogans and it gets so preachykeen and so tubthumpingly loud it makes you feel like a chump 
15660,the film has an infectious enthusiasm 
15661,is a serious work by an important director who has something new to say about how  in the flipflop of courtship  we often reel in when we should be playing out 
15662,seems intimidated by both her subject matter and the period trappings of this debut venture into the heritage business 
15663,of awakening and ripening 
15664,made eddie murphy a movie star and the man 
15665,what it was that made the story relevant in the first place 
15666, at least he provides a strong itch to explore more  
15667,stoops to cheap manipulation or corny conventions to do it 
15668,walt becker s film pushes all the demographically appropriate comic buttons  
15669,brings a youthful  outtochangetheworld aggressiveness to the project 
15670,good  sonny 
15671,the characters  quirks and foibles never jell into charm 
15672,hands out awards  with phony humility barely camouflaging grotesque narcissism 
15673,delivers the goods and audiences will have a fun  nofrills ride 
15674,one teenager s uncomfortable class resentment and 
15675, not the first  by the way  
15676, the director s experiment is a successful one  
15677,high crimes carries almost no organic intrigue as a government  marinelegal mystery  and that s because the movie serves up all of that stuff  nearly subliminally  as the oldhat province of male intrigue  
15678,about as exciting to watch as two lastplace basketball teams playing one another on the final day of the season  
15679,surprisingly refreshing 
15680,written so well  that even a simple  goddammit 
15681,none of them memorable 
15682,as an entertainment destination for the general public 
15683,such an excellent job 
15684,catch the pitch of his poetics  savor the pleasure of his sounds and images  and ponder the historical  philosophical  and ethical issues that intersect with them 
15685,an ambitiously naturalistic  albeit halfbaked  drama about an abused  innercity autistic 
15686,more fascinating look 
15687,hartley adds enough quirky and satirical touches in the screenplay to keep the film entertaining  
15688,a fine  focused piece of work 
15689,continually challenges perceptions of guilt and innocence  of good guys and bad  and asks us whether a noble end can justify evil means  
15690,aspires to the cracked lunacy of the adventures of buckaroo banzai  but thanks to an astonishingly witless script ends up more like the adventures of ford fairlane  
15691,unmotivated 
15692,did nt convince me that calvin jr s barbershop represents some sort of beacon of hope in the middle of chicago s south side  
15693,utilizes the idea of making kahlo s art a living  breathing part of the movie  often catapulting the artist into her own work  
15694,lumbering 
15695,breathes life into a roll that could have otherwise been bland and run of the mill 
15696,does nt allow an earnest moment to pass without reminding audiences that it s only a movie 
15697,are masterfully controlled 
15698,is perfectly serviceable and because he gives the story some soul 
15699,ice age only improves on it  with terrific computer graphics  inventive action sequences and a droll sense of humor 
15700,stands still in more ways that one in clockstoppers  a scifi thriller as lazy as it is interminable  
15701,a sleek advert for youthful anomie 
15702,as  a perfect family film 
15703,finds no way to entertain or inspire its viewers 
15704,hard to say who might enjoy this 
15705,a successful example 
15706,of familial separation and societal betrayal 
15707,great credit 
15708,loneliness and isolation 
15709,are wasted in it 
15710,the logic of it all will be greek to anyone not predisposed to the movie s rude and crude humor  
15711,this is nt even a movie we can enjoy as mild escapism  it is one in which fear and frustration are provoked to intolerable levels  
15712,a firstclass  thoroughly involving b movie 
15713,a few tasty morsels 
15714,highly gifted 12yearold 
15715,blade ii mutates into a grossout monster movie with effects that are more silly than scary  
15716,wildly incompetent but brilliantly named half past dead  or for seagal pessimists  totally past his prime 
15717,comes the first lousy guy ritchie imitation 
15718,a deserved cowinner of the audience award for documentaries at the sundance film festival 
15719,a weak and ineffective ghost story without a conclusion or pay off 
15720,may not be pleased 
15721,it should be doing a lot of things  but does nt  
15722,anti 
15723,lacks it  
15724,oral storytelling frozen onto film 
15725,that should ve been so much more even if it was only made for teenage boys and wrestling fans 
15726,but quietly effective 
15727,into a dullard 
15728,instead of a balanced film that explains the zeitgeist that is the x games  we get a cinematic postcard that s superficial and unrealized  
15729,the princess seem smug and cartoonish 
15730,are funny 
15731,characters who are sweet and believable  and are defeated by a screenplay that forces them into bizarre  implausible behavior 
15732,hard to make the most of a bumper 
15733,terrific as rachel 
15734,can gasp  shudder and even tremble without losing his machismo 
15735,really stupid 
15736,ryan gosling  is at 22 a powerful young actor  
15737,guilttrip 
15738, you wo nt feel like it s wasted yours 
15739,two hours of junk  
15740,human drama 
15741,it jumps around with little logic or continuity  presenting backstage bytes of information that never amount to a satisfying complete picture of this particular  anciently demanding métier  
15742, one of the most entertaining monster movies in ages 
15743,modeled on the worst revengeofthenerds clichés the filmmakers could dredge up 
15744,far more interested in grossout humor 
15745,diggs and lathan are among the chief reasons brown sugar is such a sweet and sexy film  
15746,an unbalanced mixture of graphic combat footage 
15747,re content with a clever pseudobio that manages to have a good time as it doles out pieces of the famous director s life 
15748,tries its best to hide the fact that seagal s overweight and out of shape  
15749,very top 
15750,sinks 
15751,an uninspired preachy and clichéd war 
15752,keep this from being a complete waste of time 
15753,imamura has said that warm water under a red bridge is a poem to the enduring strengths of women  
15754,s good enough to be the purr 
15755,is quite possibly the sturdiest example yet of why the dv revolution has cheapened the artistry of making a film  
15756,the smartest 
15757,as the lousy tarantino imitations have subsided 
15758,it is very difficult to care about the character  and that is the central flaw of the film 
15759,unlikable  
15760,up being both revelatory and narcissistic  achieving some honest insight into relationships that most highconcept films candycoat with pat storylines  precious circumstances and beautiful stars 
15761,an imaginatively mixed cast of antic spirits 
15762,left on a remote shelf indefinitely 
15763,a return to pure disney 
15764,a movie that will thrill you  touch you and make you laugh as well  
15765,is phenomenal  especially the women 
15766,undercuts its charm 
15767,it s all arty and jazzy and people sit and stare and turn away from one another instead of talking and it s all about the silences and if you re into that  have at it 
15768,largerthanlife figure 
15769,thrown every suspenseful cliché in the book 
15770,rare and riveting 
15771,a family film 
15772,elegant visual sense 
15773,are worth the price of admission 
15774,of being a good documentarian 
15775,very predictable but still entertaining 
15776,a christmas perennial 
15777,depressing story 
15778,meticulous talent 
15779,called freddy gets molested by a dog 
15780,solid performances 
15781,genuinely funny jokes 
15782,is  however  a completely honest  openhearted film that should appeal to anyone willing to succumb to it  
15783,have finally aged past his prime  
15784,do nt judge this one too soon 
15785,translating complex characters from novels to the big screen 
15786,rubbo runs through a remarkable amount of material in the film s short 90 minutes  
15787,consistently funny  
15788,animated by an energy that puts the dutiful efforts of more disciplined gradegrubbers 
15789,a satisfactory overview of the bizarre world of extreme athletes as several daredevils express their own views  
15790,should be required viewing for civics classes and wouldbe public servants alike 
15791,ca nt remember the last time i saw worse stunt editing or cheaper action movie production values than in extreme ops  
15792,its occasional charms are not to be dismissed  
15793,be over 
15794,the euphoria of growing up 
15795,constantly pulling the rug from underneath us 
15796,has found with an devastating  eloquent clarity 
15797,wince in embarrassment and others  
15798,on the glamorous machine that thrusts the audience into a future they wo nt much care about 
15799,that never catches fire 
15800,offensive 
15801,it s the brilliant surfing photography bringing you right inside the massive waves that lifts blue crush into one of the summer s most pleasurable movies  
15802,celebrate 
15803,deepest recesses 
15804,as good  if not better 
15805,throwaway references to faith and rainbows to plant smilebutton faces on that segment of the populace that made a walk to remember a niche hit 
15806,quite tasty and inviting all the same 
15807,movies  television and the theater 
15808,ironyfree 
15809,lasker s canny  meditative script distances sex and love  as byron and luther  
15810,it is a kind  unapologetic  sweetheart of a movie  and 
15811,its absurdity 
15812,hates 
15813,most fascinating stories 
15814,fragmentary narrative style 
15815,s been hyped to be because it plays everything too safe 
15816,of the most multilayered and sympathetic female characters of the year 
15817,it s a hellish  numbing experience to watch 
15818,is that van wilder does little that is actually funny with the material  
15819,it s an effort to watch this movie  
15820,rapidfire delivery 
15821,makes up for with its heart 
15822,effort to see an artist  still committed to growth in his ninth decade  change while remaining true to his principles 
15823,it takes chances that are bold by studio standards 
15824,opened it up for all of us to understand 
15825,imagine that most every aggrieved father cliché has been unturned 
15826,a worthy substitute 
15827,in tatters 
15828,no  even that s too committed  
15829,falling short as a whole 
15830,there is no foundation for it 
15831,is not one of the movies you d want to watch if you only had a week to live  
15832,ve got a huge mess 
15833,have all the suspense of a 20car pileup 
15834,complete waste 
15835,brow 
15836,there are rich veins of funny stuff in this movie 
15837,snooze 
15838,so poorly paced you could fit all of pootie tang in between its punchlines 
15839,sand s masculine persona  with its love of life and beauty 
15840,handles the nuclear crisis sequences evenly but milks drama when she should be building suspense  and drags out too many scenes toward the end that should move quickly  
15841,too much like an infomercial for ram dass s latest book 
15842,manages just to be depressing  as the lead actor phones in his autobiographical performance 
15843,flimsy 
15844,offensive  puerile and unimaginatively foulmouthed 
15845,sit through about 90 minutes of a socalled  comedy  and not laugh once 
15846,people may be wondering what all that jazz was about  chicago  in 2002  
15847,unique and entertaining 
15848,sadly 
15849,it should have ditched the artsy pretensions and revelled in the entertaining shallows  
15850,if it pushes its agenda too forcefully 
15851,its rough edges and a tendency to sag in certain places 
15852,mostly to the tongueincheek attitude of the screenplay 
15853,to the always hilarious meara and levy 
15854,create and sustain 
15855,one of our best actors 
15856,beacon of hope 
15857,ash wednesday is not edward burns  best film  but it is a good and ambitious film 
15858,about mad queens  obsessive relationships  and rampant adultery 
15859,making kahlo s art a living  breathing part of the movie 
15860,look back at civil disobedience  antiwar movements and the power of strong voices  
15861,such a fine idea 
15862,his lack of selfawareness 
15863,astonish 
15864,the plotting here leaves a lot to be desired 
15865, there is an accuracy of observation in the work of the director  frank novak  that keeps the film grounded in an undeniable social realism  
15866, the last kiss is really all about performances  
15867,and small delights 
15868,it s up to  watts  to lend credibility to this strange scenario  and 
15869,hubristic folly 
15870,as a piece of storytelling 
15871,a few nice twists in a standard plot 
15872,fascinating than the results 
15873,it also comes with the laziness and arrogance of a thing that already knows it s won  
15874,get inside you 
15875,bite your tongue to keep from laughing at the ridiculous dialog or the ohso convenient plot twists 
15876,a limp eddie murphy vehicle that even he seems embarrassed to be part of  
15877,s still a sweet  even delectable diversion 
15878,death to smoochy is often very funny  
15879,downfall 
15880,ve seen in a while  a meander through wornout material 
15881,it throws you for a loop  
15882,something provocative  
15883,the horrifying historical reality 
15884,assured  vital and well wrought  the film is  arguably  the most accomplished work to date from hong kong s versatile stanley kwan  
15885,bogdanovich taps deep into the hearst mystique 
15886,is too steeped in fairy tales and other childish things 
15887,surprisingly similar 
15888,goodfellas 
15889,electrocute and dismember 
15890,on both suspense and payoff 
15891,passionate 
15892,in just such a dungpile that you d swear you 
15893,give a spark to  chasing amy  and  changing lanes  falls flat as thinking man cia agent jack ryan in this summer s new action film  
15894,too often into sugary sentiment and withholds delivery on the pellmell 
15895,is downright movie penance 
15896,giving audiences no reason to truly care for its decrepit freaks beyond the promise of a reprieve from their incessant whining 
15897,faithful without being forceful  sad without being shrill 
15898,its greatest play 
15899,are the kiss of death in this bitter italian comedy 
15900,akin to a reader s digest condensed version of the source material 
15901,the most amazing supersized dosage 
15902, wallace is smart to vary the pitch of his movie  balancing deafening battle scenes with quieter domestic scenes of women back home receiving war department telegrams  
15903,coppola s directorial debut is an incredibly layered and stylistic film that  despite a fairly slow paced  almost humdrum approach to character development  still manages at least a decent attempt at meaningful cinema  
15904,you re likely wondering why you ve been watching all this strutting and posturing  
15905,it was the unfulfilling  incongruous   wait a second 
15906,reworks 
15907,is the opposite of a truly magical movie  
15908,the transcendent performance 
15909,folds under its own thinness 
15910,exceptional thriller 
15911,gripping and compelling 
15912,ca nt quite conceal that there s nothing resembling a spine here 
15913,driven by a fantastic dual performance from ian holm  the film is funny  insightfully human and a delightful lark for history buffs  
15914,tsai s usual style and themes 
15915,bring new energy to the familiar topic of office politics 
15916,its inventiveness 
15917,guarantee to have you leaving the theater with a smile on your face 
15918,crucial to the genre and another firstrate performance 
15919,one of the most original american productions this year 
15920,what a bewilderingly brilliant and entertaining movie 
15921,a ship as leaky 
15922,finds a nice rhythm  
15923,dragonfly  dwells on crossingover mumbo jumbo  manipulative sentimentality  and sappy dialogue  
15924,is hell 
15925,deserves recommendation 
15926,then again  subtlety has never been his trademark 
15927,my big fat greek wedding  comes from the heart 
15928,a child s interest and 
15929,although olivier assayas  elegantly appointed period drama seems  at times  padded with incident in the way of a tooconscientious adaptation  its threehour running time plays closer to two  
15930,possibly the most irresponsible picture ever released by a major film studio  
15931,highpowered 
15932,an unmistakable  easy joie de vivre 
15933,could use more of  spirit  perception  conviction 
15934,they turn out to be delightfully compatible here 
15935, you ll have a good time with this one too 
15936,aims so low 
15937,of the most frantic  virulent and foulnatured christmas season pics ever delivered by a hollywood studio 
15938,the hell 
15939,unrelenting bleak insistence 
15940,wild ride  
15941, wannabehip crime comedy 
15942,ingeniously 
15943,that the less charitable might describe as a castrated 
15944,marks a modest if encouraging return 
15945,incorporates rotoscope animation for no apparent reason except 
15946,hard to quibble with a flick boasting this many genuine cackles 
15947,of teendriven  toilethumor codswallop 
15948,starts out strongly before quickly losing its focus  point and purpose in a mess of mixed messages  overblown drama and bruce willis with a scar  
15949,ca nt remember a single name responsible for it 
15950,then the film is a pleasant enough dish  
15951,is that i ca nt remember a single name responsible for it 
15952,bring out joys in our lives that we never knew 
15953,the otherwise goodnaturedness of mr deeds  with its embrace of sheer goofiness and cameos of less 
15954, and fearlessness 
15955,like the english patient and the unbearable lightness of being 
15956,is often preachy and 
15957,is clever 
15958,as awful as some of the recent hollywood trip tripe 
15959,gets off with a good natured warning 
15960,though writerdirector bart freundlich s film ultimately becomes a simplistic story about a dysfunctional parentchild relationship  it has some special qualities and the soulful gravity of crudup s anchoring performance  
15961,is worth your time 
15962, fun  curiously adolescent movie 
15963,the production has been made with an enormous amount of affection  so 
15964,s an entertaining movie 
15965,how horrible we are to ourselves and each other 
15966,done a fine job of updating white s dry wit to a new age 
15967,except a lingering creepiness one feels from being dragged through a sad  sordid universe of guns  drugs  avarice and damaged dreams 
15968,gets vivid  convincing performances from a fine cast 
15969,an intelligent movie in which you can release your pent up anger 
15970,susan sarandon 
15971,very valuable 
15972,a nice cool glass of iced tea 
15973,could nt help but 
15974,would have a résumé loaded with credits like  girl in bar  3   
15975,the film is an earnest try at beachcombing verismo 
15976,only with muscles and a lot more smarts  but just as endearing and easy to watch 
15977,complex  unpredictable character 
15978,visually flashy but narratively opaque and emotionally vapid 
15979,on courtroom movies  a few nifty twists that are so crucial to the genre and another firstrate performance by topbilled star bruce willis 
15980,means a great movie 
15981,done cinematically 
15982,not smart or barbed enough for older viewers 
15983,mostly believable  
15984,a personal low for everyone involved 
15985,a droll  bitchy frolic which pokes fun at the price of popularity and smalltown pretension in the lone star state  
15986,is so warm and fuzzy 
15987,of the current political climate 
15988,clearly see the world of our making  
15989,falls back 
15990,a disaster of a story  
15991,know how to suffer  and if you see this film you ll know too  
15992,dazzling panoramic shots that make the most of the largescreen format  before swooping down on a string of exotic locales  scooping the whole world up in a joyous communal festival of rhythm 
15993,deserving of its critical backlash and more 
15994,to the core 
15995,it may also be the best sex comedy about environmental pollution ever made  
15996,which is way too stagy 
15997,really what we demand of the director 
15998,the emotion is impressively true for being so hotblooded  and both leads are up to the task  
15999,whereas oliver stone s conspiracy thriller jfk was long  intricate  starstudded and visually flashy  interview with the assassin draws its considerable power from simplicity  
16000,by those willing to endure its extremely languorous rhythms  waiting for happiness 
16001,is nt even halfway 
16002,begins with promise  but runs aground after being snared in its own tangled plot 
16003,are just so weird that i honestly never knew what the hell was coming next  
16004,this gentle  mesmerizing portrait of a man coming to terms with time 
16005,gets under your skin and  some plot blips aside 
16006,my indignant  preemptive departure 
16007,even the stuffiest cinema goers will laugh their  off for an hourandahalf 
16008,no quarter

16408,recommended as an engrossing story about a horrifying historical event and the elements which contributed to it  
16409,like being able to hit on a 15year old when you re over 100 
16410,in making me groggy 
16411,the sentimental script has problems  but the actors pick up the slack  
16412,s as if de palma spent an hour setting a fancy table and then served up kraft macaroni and cheese 
16413,of lowgrade dreck that usually goes straight to video  with a lousy script  inept direction  pathetic acting  poorly dubbed dialogue and murky cinematography  complete with visible boom mikes 
16414,foodspittingly

16419,are forced to reflect that its visual imagination is breathtaking 
16420,patchy 
16421,it is supremely unfunny and unentertaining to watch middleage and older men drink to excess  piss on trees  bs one another and put on a show in drag 
16422,illconsidered notion 
16423,it s easy to love robin tunney  she s pretty and she can act  but it gets harder and harder to understand her choices  
16424,might describe as a castrated 
16425,exploitative for the art houses and too cynical  small and 
16426,no trouble sitting for blade ii 
16427,it is easy to take this film at face value and enjoy its slightly humorous and tender story 
16428,considered careerbest performances 
16429,a popcorn film  not a mustown  or even a mustsee 
16430,the film is extremely thorough  
16431,has some of the funniest jokes of any movie 
16432,celebrates the group s playful spark of nonconformity  glancing vividly back at what hibiscus grandly called his  angels of light 
16433,farts  urine  feces  semen  or 
16434,jackass lacks aspirations of social upheaval  
16435,exalts the marxian dream of honest working folk  with little to show for their labor  living harmoniously  joined in song  
16436,above the level of a telanovela 
16437, it makes me wonder if lawrence hates criticism so much that he refuses to evaluate his own work  
16438,been modeled on the worst revengeofthenerds clichés the filmmakers could dredge up 
16439,a glimmer of intelligence or invention 
16440,the trap of the maudlin or tearful 
16441,a vampire soap opera that does nt make much 
16442,provides a nice change of mindless pace in collision with the hot oscar season currently underway 
16443,letdown 
16444,jeunet 
16445,has its share of belly laughs  including a knockout of a closing line  
16446,a small movie with a big heart  
16447,one that should be thrown back in the river 
16448,trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as very important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a hollywood product 
16449,are fantasti 
16450,a single man s struggle to regain his life  his dignity and his music 
16451,wise and deadpan 
16452,no  it s not as singleminded as john carpenter s original  but it s sure a lot smarter and more unnerving than the sequels  
16453,surprisingly romantic 
16454, the film has in kieran culkin a pitchperfect holden  
16455,in all the annals of the movies  few films have been this odd  inexplicable and unpleasant  
16456,this woefully hackneyed movie  directed by scott kalvert  
16457,the unique niche of selfcritical  behindthescenes navelgazing kaufman has carved from orleans  story and his own infinite insecurity is a work of outstanding originality  
16458,fragmented film 
16459,the chateau has one very funny joke and a few other decent ones 
16460,attempts to fashion a brazillike  hyperreal satire 
16461,appreciates the art and reveals a music scene that transcends culture and race  
16462,equilibrium becomes a concept doofus 
16463,boredom 
16464,terrific as nadia  a russian mailorder bride who comes to america speaking not a word of english  it s kidman who holds the film together with a supremely kittenish performance that gradually accumulates more layers  
16465,is a shrewd and effective film from a director who understands how to create and sustain a mood  
16466,a visually stunning rumination on love  memory  history and the war between art and commerce 
16467,fun and 
16468,s both sitcomishly predictable and cloying in its attempts 
16469,works on no level whatsoever for me 
16470,shanghai ghetto may not be as dramatic as roman polanski s the pianist  but its compassionate spirit soars every bit as high  
16471,exceedingly pleasant

16476,an emotionally strong and politically potent piece of cinema  
16477,postcard perfect 
16478,that did not figure out a coherent game 
16479,s as raw and actionpacked an experience as a ringside seat at a toughman contest 
16480,recycles every cliché about gays in what is essentially an extended soap opera  
16481, hayek  throws herself into this dream hispanic role with a teethclenching gusto  she strikes a potent chemistry with molina and 
16482,it s a rollicking adventure for you and all your mateys  regardless of their ages  
16483,who is a welcome relief from the usual twodimensional offerings 
16484,lifts blue crush into one of the summer s most pleasurable movies 
16485,otherwise excellent film 
16486,the biggest problem with roger avary s uproar against the mpaa is that  even in all its director s cut glory  he s made a film that s barely shocking  barely interesting and most of all  barely anything  
16487,when we hear the ultimate fate of these girls and realize  much to our dismay  that this really did happen 
16488,had no effect and elicited no sympathies for any of the characters 
16489,a puppy dog so desperate for attention it nearly breaks its little neck trying to perform entertaining tricks

16496,strong 
16497,their way around this movie directionless  lacking any of the rollicking dark humor so necessary 
16498,in this marvelous film 
16499, there would be a tossup between presiding over the end of cinema as we know it and another night of delightful hand shadows  
16500,this a remarkable and novel concept 
16501,first and 
16502,nothing more than a widget cranked out on an assembly line to see if stupid americans will get a kick out of goofy brits with cute accents performing agesold slapstick and unfunny tricks

16515,you never know where changing lanes is going to take you but it s a heck of a ride  
16516,can cross swords with the best of them and helm a more traditionally plotted popcorn thriller while surrendering little of his intellectual rigor or creative composure 
16517,a powerful sequel and 
16518,all great films about a life you never knew existed

16528,kung pow seems like some futile concoction that was developed hastily after oedekerk and 
16529,whose riveting memories are rendered with such clarity that it s as if it all happened only yesterday 
16530,a document of what it felt like to be a new yorker  or  really  to be a human being  in the weeks after 911 
16531,even though we know the outcome  the seesawing of the general s fate in the arguments of competing lawyers has the stomachknotting suspense of a legal thriller  while the testimony of witnesses lends the film a resonant undertone of tragedy

16537,a sharp and quick documentary 
16538,oddly  the film is nt nearly as downbeat as it sounds  but strikes a tone that s alternately melancholic  hopeful and strangely funny  
16539,on intimate relationships 
16540,as literary desecrations go  this makes for perfectly acceptable  occasionally very enjoyable children s entertainment  
16541,to see if stupid americans will get a kick out of goofy brits with cute accents performing agesold slapstick and unfunny tricks 
16542,unambitious 
16543,straight to video 
16544,in its characterizations 
16545,no wrong 
16546,is little more than home alone raised to a new  selfdeprecating level  
16547,limited and so embellished by editing that there s really not much of a sense of action or even actioncomedy 
16548,almost entirely witless and inane  
16549,like schindler s list  the grey zone attempts to be grandiloquent  but ends up merely pretentious  in a grisly sort of way  
16550,special effects that run the gamut from cheesy to cheesier to cheesiest 
16551,vain for a movie 
16552,the most purely enjoyable and satisfying evenings at the movies 
16553,it still comes from spielberg  who has never made anything that was nt at least watchable 
16554,75 wasted minutes of sandler as the voiceover hero in columbia pictures  perverse idea of an animated holiday movie 
16555, the characters make italian for beginners worth the journey 
16556, it rises in its courageousness  and comedic employment  
16557,s much to recommend the film

16570,accept it as life and 
16571,a little less extreme than in the past  with longer exposition sequences between them  and with fewer gags to break the tedium  
16572,it can not even be dubbed hedonistic 
16573,not to mention absolutely refreshed

16597,that s refreshing after the phoniness of femalebonding pictures like divine secrets of the yaya sisterhood 
16598,unlike  scorsese s mean streets   ash wednesday is essentially devoid of interesting characters or even a halfway intriguing plot

16626,giggles 
16627,is that it s actually watchable  
16628,what ensues are much bloodsplattering  mass druginduced bowel evacuations  and nonetoofunny commentary on the cultural distinctions between americans and brits  
16629,s a terrible movie in every regard  and utterly painful to watch 
16630,meanspirited second half 
16631, it eventually works its way up to merely bad rather than painfully awful  
16632,marvel again 
16633,kids will love its fantasy and adventure  and grownups should appreciate its whimsical humor  
16634,everything humanly possible to create characters who are sweet and believable  and are defeated by a screenplay that forces them into bizarre  implausible behavior 
16635,story is almost an afterthought 
16636,did nt mean much to me and played too skewed to ever get a hold on 
16637,quite tasteful to look at

16646,radioactive hair 
16647,what the movie lacks in action it more than makes up for in drama  suspense  revenge  and romance  
16648,looking like a bunch of talented thesps slumming it 
16649,a baffling subplot involving smuggling drugs inside danish cows falls flat  and if you re going to alter the bard s ending  you d better have a good alternative 
16650,to rush through the intermediary passages  apparently hoping that the audience will not notice the glaring triteness of the plot device

16655,s a wellwritten and occasionally challenging social drama that actually has something interesting to say 
16656,the movie s progression into rambling incoherence gives new meaning to the phrase  fatal script error   
16657,humorless  selfconscious art drivel 
16658,arch and rather coldblooded comedy 
16659,the film buzz and whir  
16660,why this did nt connect with me would require another viewing 
16661,disgusted 
16662,a genre that s already a joke in the united states  
16663,is at once luridly graphic and laughably unconvincing 
16664,slack and uninspired  and peopled mainly by characters so unsympathetic that you re left with a sour taste in your mouth  
16665,it s a pretty good execution of a story that s a lot richer than the ones hollywood action screenwriters usually come up with on their own  
16666,beautifully shot  but 
16667,infused frida with a visual style unique and inherent 
16668,as offensive 
16669,too many story lines

16675,easy to swallow  
16676,has been made with an enormous amount of affection 
16677,a kind of perpetual pain 
16678,the film has an infectious enthusiasm and 
16679,might be some sort of credible genderprovoking philosophy submerged here  but who the hell cares  
16680,venture forth 
16681,visually captivating  
16682,more sophisticated and literate than such pictures

16690,peralta captures  in luminous interviews and amazingly evocative film from three decades ago  the essence of the dogtown experience  
16691,there s a great deal of corny dialogue and preposterous moments  
16692,good guy 
16693,a very good film 
16694,stultifying 
16695,great premise 
16696,to figure out that this is a mormon family movie  and a sappy  preachy one at that 
16697,a summer 
16698,scuzzy 
16699,draws you 
16700,would have liked it much more if harry  tonto never existed 
16701,idea  of middleaged romance  is not handled well and  
16702,the sketchiest 
16703,the kind of movie that s criticproof  simply because it aims so low 
16704,left me feeling refreshed and hopeful 
16705,intoxicating documentary charting the rise of hiphop culture in general and the art of scratching  or turntablism  in particular 
16706,hollow tribute 
16707,to proceed as the world implodes 
16708,goodnatured fun 
16709,hunky hasbeen

16714,surprisingly charming and even witty match 
16715,the most severe kind 
16716,the nerveraked acting  the crackle of lines  the impressive stagings of hardware  make for some robust and scary entertainment  
16717,turns a potentially interesting idea into an excruciating film school experience that plays better only for the film s publicists or for people who take as many drugs as the film s characters 
16718,pretty unbelievable 
16719,it s the perfect cure for insomnia  
16720,touched by the film s conviction that all life centered on that place  that time and that sport 
16721,good action  
16722,remains fairly light  always entertaining  and smartly written 
16723,too damn weird 
16724,has stepped into the mainstream of filmmaking with an assurance worthy of international acclaim and with every cinematic tool well under his control  
16725,defeats the possibility of creating a more darkly edged tome 
16726,lightweight female empowerment 
16727,should catch this imax offering  
16728,catching solely on its visual merits 
16729,i liked about schmidt a lot 
16730,painful improbability 
16731,to see how far herzog has fallen 
16732,as dahmer 
16733, seems  even more uselessly redundant and shamelessly moneygrubbing than most thirdrate horror sequels  
16734,had to escape from director mark romanek s selfconscious scrutiny 
16735,the elements were all there 
16736,overdone 
16737,tartakovsky s team has some freakish powers of visual charm  but the five writers slip into the modern rut of narrative banality 
16738,has created a brilliant motion picture 
16739,a film tailormade for those who when they were in high school would choose the cliffnotes over reading a fulllength classic 
16740,has arrived for an incongruous summer playoff  demonstrating yet again that the era of the intelligent  wellmade b movie is long gone  
16741,for a winning  heartwarming yarn

16748,yet  it must be admitted 
16749,charm  cultivation and devotion to his people are readily apparent 
16750,lovably 
16751,will find little of interest in this film  which is often preachy and poorly acted  
16752, and among the best films of the year

16762,while bollywoodhollywood will undoubtedly provide its keenest pleasures to those familiar with bombay musicals  it also has plenty for those  like me  who are nt  
16763,captures all the longing  anguish and ache  the confusing sexual messages and the wish 
16764,it s hardly a necessary enterprise  
16765,it has no affect on the kurds  but it wore me down  
16766,riveting 
16767,maggie smith as the yaya member with the o2tank will absolutely crack you up with her crass  then gasp for gas  verbal deportment

16773,abandon their scripts and go where the moment takes them 
16774,the movie has a tougher time balancing its violence with kafkainspired philosophy 
16775,makes it a party worth attending  
16776,disgusting to begin with 
16777,that while cleverly worked out  can not overcome blah characters 
16778,as imaginative as one might have hoped 
16779,children and adults enamored of all things pokemon wo nt be disappointed

16784,british comedy  
16785,the one thing most will take away is the sense that peace is possible 
16786,was worse  
16787,the thought of watching this film with an audience full of teenagers fixating on its body humor and reinforcement of stereotypes 
16788,off too far 
16789,is so charmless and vacant 
16790,is far from disappointing 
16791,draws its considerable power from simplicity  
16792,smoochy 
16793,delia  greta  and paula rank as three of the most multilayered and sympathetic female characters of the year  
16794,of one of the greatest natural sportsmen of modern times 
16795,drag it down to mediocrity  
16796,of the greatest date movies in years 
16797,too predictably 
16798,a woozy quality 
16799,none of which amounts to much of a story 
16800,too long to turn his movie in an unexpected direction 
16801,is extremely thorough  
16802,dead production 
16803,a talented director 
16804,superficiality and 
16805,a distinguished and thoughtful film  marked by acute writing and a host of splendid performances  
16806,you will likely enjoy this monster 
16807,assuredly 
16808,are underwhelming 
16809,always the prettiest pictures 
16810,giddy viewing 
16811,pathosfilled but ultimately lifeaffirming 
16812,makes you feel like a chump 
16813,familyoriented 
16814,almost every possible way  from the writing and direction to the soggy performances  
16815,familiar situations and repetitive scenes 
16816,is a pretty decent little documentary 
16817, a formula comedy redeemed by its stars  that is even lazier and far less enjoyable  
16818,a little melodramatic  but with enough 
16819,speculation  conspiracy theories or  at best  circumstantial evidence 
16820,resolutely unamusing 
16821,cast and well directed  a powerful drama with enough sardonic wit to keep it from being maudlin 
16822,a confluence of kiddie entertainment  sophisticated wit and symbolic graphic design  
16823, gulpilil  is a commanding screen presence  and his character s abundant humanism makes him the film s moral compass  
16824,keenly

16828,this film is so different from the apple and so striking that it can only encourage us to see samira makhmalbaf as a very distinctive sensibility  working to develop her own film language with conspicuous success  
16829,one reason it s so lackluster 
16830,an enjoyable comedy 
16831,give full performances 
16832,a great idea 
16833,affecting  amusing  sad and reflective 
16834,except as a harsh conceptual exercise 
16835,is misbegotten 
16836,becomes a fascinating study of isolation and frustration that successfully recreates both the physical setting and emotional tensions of the papin sisters 
16837,the lady and the duke surprisingly manages never to grow boring  which proves that rohmer still has a sense of his audience  
16838,the sensational truecrime 
16839,little atmosphere is generated by the shadowy lighting 
16840,the improperly hammy performance 
16841,followed through 
16842,many different ideas from happiness 
16843,the scenes of torture and selfmutilation 
16844,when it drags 
16845,cultural intrigue 
16846,heaven proves to be a good match of the sensibilities of two directors  
16847,flat  misguided comedy 
16848,while the humor aspects of  jason x  were far more entertaining than i had expected  everything else about the film tanks  
16849,to a pictureperfect beach 
16850,an objective documentary 
16851,s something impressive and yet lacking about everything  
16852, sets the tone for a summer of good stuff

16854,are more involving than this mess  
16855,intriguing questions 
16856,a respectable new one 
16857,more like a travelagency video 
16858,this humbling little film  fueled by the light comedic work of zhao benshan and the delicate ways of dong jie 
16859,scenery  vibe and all  the cinematic equivalent of a big  tender hug 
16860,serves as a rather thin moral 
16861,very ugly  very fast 
16862,poignant and 
16863,full of life and small delights 
16864,emptiness and maddeningly 
16865,a main character who sometimes defies sympathy 
16866,begins to vaporize from your memory minutes after it ends 
16867,infuriating 
16868,been saved if the director  tom dey  had spliced together bits and pieces of midnight run and 48 hours  and  for that matter  shrek  
16869,if you re willing to have fun with it  you wo nt feel cheated by the high infidelity of unfaithful  
16870,ultimate insignificance 
16871,which may be why it works as well as it does 
16872,those rare docs that paints a grand picture of an era and makes the journey feel like a party 
16873,rather than provocative 
16874,of the movie s charm 
16875,succeed in producing that most frightening of all movies  a mediocre horror film too bad to be good and too good to be bad  
16876,in its own direction 
16877,an appalling  ace ventura  ripoff that somehow manages to bring together kevin pollak  former wrestler chyna and dolly parton 
16878,the characters are based on stock clichés  and 
16879, like i already mentioned  it s robert duvall  
16880,have been lost in the translation this time 
16881,bertrand tavernier s oftbrilliant safe conduct   laissezpasser   
16882,spent the duration of the film s shooting schedule waiting to scream 
16883,leguizamo and jones are both excellent and 
16884,will no doubt rally to its cause  trotting out threadbare standbys like  masterpiece  and  triumph  and all that malarkey  but 
16885,some fairly unsettling scenes 
16886,fascinating and 
16887,with results that are sometimes bracing  sometimes baffling and quite often  
16888,long gone bottomofthebill fare 
16889,remains the real masterpiece 
16890,a plotline that s as lumpy as twoday old porridge  the filmmakers  paws  sad to say  were all over this  unbearable  project 
16891,even when crush departs from the 4w formula  it feels like a glossy rehash  
16892,god bless crudup and his aversion to taking the easy hollywood road and cashing in on his moviestar 
16893,banality 
16894,the passion  creativity  and fearlessness of one of mexico s most colorful and controversial artists 
16895,the price of admission for the ridicule factor 
16896,it s hard to take her spiritual quest at all seriously 
16897,is a fragmented film 
16898,magnificent 
16899,manic and energetic 
16900,the best irish sense 
16901,comfortably 
16902,grant is certainly amusing

16904,and moving portrait 
16905,franchise possibilities 
16906,s on par with the first one 
16907,to share his story so compellingly with us is a minor miracle 
16908,thoughtless  random  superficial humor and a lot of very bad scouse accents 
16909,it s really little more than a particularly slanted  gay sm fantasy  enervating and deadeningly drawnout  
16910,this trifling romantic comedy in which opposites attract for no better reason than that the screenplay demands it 
16911,make an oldfashioned nature film that educates viewers with words and pictures while entertaining them 
16912,caring for animals and respecting other cultures 
16913,the film exudes the urbane sweetness that woody allen seems to have bitterly forsaken  
16914,effective in all its aspects  margarita happy hour represents an auspicious feature debut for chaiken  
16915,the dialogue is frequently overwrought and crudely literal 
16916,ca nt see why any actor of talent would ever work in a mcculloch production again if they looked at how this movie turned out  
16917,the wit and hoopla 
16918,is a movie that is what it is  a pleasant distraction  a friday night diversion  an excuse to eat popcorn 
16919,would leave you cold 
16920,two weeks notice has appeal beyond being a sandra bullock vehicle or a standard romantic comedy  
16921,a deeply unpleasant experience 
16922,another example of how sandler is losing his touch 
16923, dong  makes a valiant effort to understand everyone s point of view

16927,spreading a puritanical brand of christianity 
16928,gentle  mesmerizing portrait 
16929,is an inyourface family drama and black comedy that is filled with raw emotions conveying despair and love  
16930, to say nothing of boring  
16931,in this film  which may be why it works as well as it does 
16932,a major opportunity to be truly revelatory about his psyche 
16933,unholy hokum  
16934,the original was nt a good movie but this remake makes it look like a masterpiece

16937,perfect comic timing 
16938,be funny  uplifting and moving  sometimes 
16939,wallace  who wrote gibson s braveheart as well as the recent pearl harbor  has such an irrepressible passion for sappy situations and dialogue 
16940,a riveting profile of law enforcement  and a visceral  nasty journey 
16941,it is a good and ambitious film 
16942,could have  should have 
16943,too dry 
16944,it s rare to find a film to which the adjective  gentle  applies  but the word perfectly describes pauline  paulette  
16945,stay in touch with your own skin 
16946,does nt wrap the proceedings up neatly 
16947,been there  done that  liked it much better the first time around  when it was called the professional  
16948,a long  dull procession of despair 
16949,lack contrast 
16950,the movie that does nt really deliver for country music fans or for family audiences 
16951, best works understand why snobbery is a better satiric target than middleamerica 
16952,pollute the summer movie pool 
16953,s not a fresh idea 
16954,a bland animated sequel that hardly seems worth the effort  
16955,lowbrow 
16956,left with a sour taste in one s mouth  and little else 
16957,while there s likely very little crossover appeal to those without much interest in the elizabethans  as well as rank frustration from those in the know about rubbo s dumbeddown tactics  
16958,teenspeak and animal gibberish 
16959,this deeply moving french drama 
16960,an athlete  a movie star  
16961,not in order to excuse him but rather to demonstrate that his pathology evolved from human impulses that grew hideously twisted 
16962,works because of the universal themes  earnest performances  and excellent use of music by india s popular gulzar and jagjit singh 
16963,of the pushiness and decibel volume of most contemporary comedies 
16964,spirit is a visual treat 
16965,display than a movie  which normally is expected to have characters and a storyline 
16966,how a skillful filmmaker can impart a message without bludgeoning the audience over the head

16968,going to be everyone s bag of popcorn 
16969,95minute commercial 
16970,pure adrenalin 
16971,puts wang at the forefront of china s sixth generation of film makers 
16972,seems uncertain whether it wants to be an acidic allmale all about eve or a lush  swooning melodrama in the intermezzo strain 
16973,the relationships were wonderful 
16974,this  unbearable  project 
16975,humorless and 
16976,positively shakesperean 
16977,offer any insights that have nt been thoroughly debated in the media already  back in the dahmer heyday of the mid  90s 
16978,ironically has little to do with the story  which becomes something about how lame it is to try and evade your responsibilities and that you should never  ever  leave a large dog alone with a toddler  
16979,even a story immersed in love  lust  and sin 
16980,own preciousness 
16981,humanism 
16982,and even touching 
16983,painfully forced  false and fabricated 
16984,fill this character study with poetic force and buoyant feeling 
16985,does nt completely 
16986,a good alternative 
16987,hoffman keeps us riveted with every painful nuance  unexpected flashes of dark comedy and the character s gripping humanity  
16988,by having the evil aliens  laser guns actually hit something for once 
16989,in the pianist 
16990,the cumulative effect of watching this 65minute trifle 
16991,more appropriate 
16992,the final effect is like having two guys yelling in your face for two hours  
16993,depraved  incoherent  instantly disposable 
16994,if you believe that the shocking conclusion is too much of a plunge or 
16995, painful  obnoxious 
16996,more interested in entertaining itself than in amusing us 
16997,but is sabotaged by ticking time bombs and other hollywoodaction cliches  
16998,one of those movies that catches you up in something bigger than yourself 
16999,dramatized pbs program 
17000,an enjoyable above average summer diversion 
17001,sucking you in  
17002,it would count for very little if the movie were nt as beautifully shaped and as delicately calibrated in tone as it is 
17003, the movie is certainly easy to watch  
17004,a tiny sense of hope 
17005,delicious dialogue 
17006,prevails 
17007,allowed to use the word  new  in its title  because there s not an original character  siuation or joke in the entire movie 
17008,splashed with bloody beauty as vivid as any scorsese has ever given us  
17009,of establishing a time and place  and of telling a fascinating character s story 
17010,most irresponsible 
17011,quirky comedy 
17012,is little more than home alone raised to a new  selfdeprecating level 
17013,affectionately goofy 
17014,has tackled a meaty subject and drawn engaging characters while peppering the pages with memorable zingers  
17015,might want to take a reality check before you pay the full ticket price to see  simone   and consider a dvd rental instead 
17016,managed to find something new to add to the canon of chan 
17017,ultimately losing cause 
17018,warm and winning 
17019,is completely 
17020,is just too original to be ignored 
17021,best 60 minutes 
17022,flashbulb editing as cover for the absence of narrative continuity 
17023,are all in the performances  from foreman s barkingmad taylor to thewlis s smoothly sinister freddie and bettanymcdowell s hardeyed gangster 
17024,that caruso takes an atypically hypnotic approach to a world that s often handled in fastedit  hoppedup fashion 
17025,nudity  profanity and violence 
17026,directed  a powerful drama with enough sardonic wit to keep it from being maudlin 
17027,a besotted and obvious drama that tells us nothing new 
17028,impostor deviously adopts the guise of a modern motion picture 
17029,like arnold schwarzenegger 
17030,monumental achievement 
17031,murphy s expert comic timing 
17032,lacks considerable brio 
17033,delivers the sexy razzledazzle that everyone  especially movie musical fans  has been hoping for 
17034,is a celebration of feminine energy  a tribute to the power of women to heal  
17035,in this flat effort 
17036,the dv revolution has cheapened the artistry of making a film 
17037,trite 
17038,this readymade midnight movie probably wo nt stand the cold light of day  but 
17039,the lackofattention span 
17040,adroit but finally a trifle flat  mad love does nt galvanize its outrage the way  say  jane campion might have done  but at least it possesses some  
17041,makes little attempt 
17042,of the match that should be used to burn every print of the film 
17043,by forming a chain of relationships that come full circle to end on a positive  if tragic  note 
17044,we do nt avert our eyes for a moment  
17045,s also uninspired  
17046,shanghai ghetto may not be as dramatic as roman polanski s the pianist  but its compassionate spirit soars every bit as high 
17047,a touching love story 
17048,a gentle  unforced intimacy that never becomes claustrophobic 
17049,s certainly an invaluable record of that special fishy community 
17050,too fluffy 
17051,rent this on video 
17052,a treat for its depiction on not giving up on dreams when you re a struggling nobody  
17053,dwindles  
17054,is powerful and provocative  
17055,an honest attempt to get at something 
17056,its botches 
17057,inertia to arrest development in a deadend existence 
17058,boring and obvious 
17059,is that van wilder does little that is actually funny with the material 
17060, director john schultz colors the picture in some evocative shades  
17061,these characters love each other 
17062,benefit enormously from the cockettes  camera craziness  not only did they film performances 
17063,an engrossing and grim portrait 
17064,it s not quite the genrebusting film it s been hyped to be because it plays everything too safe  
17065,bogdanich is unashamedly proserbian and makes little attempt to give voice to the other side  
17066,punctuated by sudden shocks 
17067,its otherwise comic narrative 
17068,reenacting a historic scandal 
17069,is such a blip on the year s radar screen that it s tempting just to go with it for the ride  
17070,ends with scenes so true and heartbreaking 
17071,will talk about for hours  
17072,thenight 
17073,as the most original in years 
17074,from start to finish  featuring a fall from grace that still leaves shockwaves 
17075,adam sandler s heart may be in the right place 
17076,why he keeps being cast in action films when none of them are ever any good 
17077,regardless of race 
17078,s not nearly enough that s right 
17079, the first film s lovely flakiness is gone  replaced by the forced funniness found in the dullest kiddie flicks  
17080,the intensity 
17081,about as unsettling to watch as an exploratory medical procedure or an autopsy 
17082,feels like a spectator and not a participant 
17083,adorably ditsy but heartfelt 
17084,the performance of gedeck  who makes martha enormously endearing 
17085,lacks the spirit of the previous two  and makes all those jokes about hos

17106,miyazaki s nonstop images are so stunning  and his imagination so vivid  that the only possible complaint you could have about spirited away is that there is no rest period  no timeout  
17107,a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma 
17108,you enjoy being rewarded by a script that assumes you are nt very bright 
17109,of tastelessness and gall 
17110,is it possible for a documentary to be utterly entranced by its subject and still show virtually no understanding of it

17124,long and relentlessly saccharine film 
17125,the film can depress you about life itself  
17126,botching a routine assignment 
17127,this like the dreaded king brown snake 
17128,the film would have been more enjoyable had the balance shifted in favor of waterbound action over the landbased  drama   but the emphasis on the latter leaves blue crush waterlogged  
17129,a creepy  intermittently powerful study of a selfdestructive man  
17130,is smart and dark  hallelujah for small favors

17143,until it goes off the rails in its final 10 or 15 minutes  wendigo  larry fessenden s spooky new thriller  is a refreshingly smart and newfangled variation on several themes derived from far less sophisticated and knowing horror films  
17144,this particular  anciently demanding métier 
17145,brings this unknown slice of history affectingly 
17146,which is worth seeing 
17147,especially disappointing

17193,the best korean film of 2002 
17194,a severe case of hollywooditis 
17195,can tell you that there s no other reason why anyone should bother remembering it 
17196,is left slightly unfulfilled  
17197,that just does nt work 
17198,the big ending surprise 
17199,mostly honest 
17200,too dry and too placid 
17201,to blow it 
17202,ransacks its archives for a quickbuck sequel  
17203, evans is  a fascinating character  and deserves a better vehicle than this facetious smirk of a movie  
17204,we care about the story 
17205,another arnold vehicle that fails to make adequate use of his particular talents  
17206,why bother with a contemptible imitator starring a  snl  hasbeen acting like an 8yearold channeling roberto benigni  
17207,screams out  amateur  in almost every frame 
17208,a fun one 
17209,crazy  mixedup films 
17210,a bit too much like an infomercial for ram dass s latest book aimed at the boomer 
17211,a level of connection and concern 
17212,the film boasts at least a few good ideas and features some decent performances  but the result is disappointing 
17213,there is a great deal of fun  
17214,it is quite a vision  
17215,a winning  heartwarming yarn 
17216,might be like trying to eat brussels sprouts  
17217,fairly basic comedic constructs 
17218,seen this summer 
17219,ahead of paintbynumber american blockbusters like pearl harbor  at least 
17220, somehow it all comes together to create a very compelling  sensitive  intelligent and almost cohesive piece of film entertainment 
17221,a shifting tone that falls far short of the peculiarly moral amorality of  woo s  best work 
17222,waydowntown may not be an important movie  or even a good one  
17223,s so fascinating you wo nt be able to look away for a second 
17224,a heroine who comes across as both shallow and dimwitted 
17225,the worst kind of hollywood heartstring plucking 
17226,a bittersweet film  
17227,of an authentic feel 
17228,flaccid 
17229,a huge boxoffice hit in korea 
17230,horribly depressing 
17231,is nt one moment in the film that surprises or delights  
17232,restoring the luster of the national lampoon film franchise  too long reduced to directtovideo irrelevancy 
17233,like a documentary in the way 
17234,the huskies are beautiful  the border collie is funny 
17235,a slick  engrossing melodrama  
17236, the tale of her passionate  tumultuous affair with musset unfolds as sand s masculine persona  with its love of life and beauty  takes form  
17237,overindulgent tirade 
17238,songbird britney spears has popped up with more mindless drivel 
17239, these components combine into one terrific story with lots of laughs  
17240,engaging mystery 
17241,flat effort 
17242,dramatically satisfying 
17243,uncommonly moving 
17244,makes the move from pleasing 
17245,it s also uninspired  lacking the real talent and wit to elevate it beyond its formula to the level of classic romantic comedy to which it aspires  
17246,bogged down by an overly sillified plot and stopandstart pacing 
17247,the worst film of the year  
17248,funny  puzzling movie 
17249,rich and intelligent 
17250,hope and magic 
17251,one of the most depressing moviegoing experiences i can think of is to sit through about 90 minutes of a socalled  comedy  and not laugh once  
17252,rattling the viewer 
17253,gives her best performance since abel ferrara had her beaten to a pulp in his dangerous game 
17254,mustsee 
17255,in the rush of slapstick thoroughfare 
17256,does nt know what it wants to be 
17257,stumbles over every cheap trick in the book trying to make the outrage come even easier  
17258,more fun watching spy than i had with most of the big summer movies 
17259,treated to an impressive and highly entertaining celebration of its sounds 
17260,absurdist spider web  
17261,refuses to spell things out for viewers 
17262,plays like one long  meandering sketch inspired by the works of john waters and todd solondz  rather than a fully developed story  
17263,you might wind up remembering with a degree of affection rather than revulsion 
17264,not everyone will welcome or accept the trials of henry kissinger as faithful portraiture  but 
17265,a  range 
17266,staring 
17267,this movie may not have the highest production values you ve ever seen 
17268,of five blind  crippled  amish people alive in this situation 
17269,it makes even elizabeth hurley seem graceless and ugly  
17270,all leather pants  augmented boobs  hawn 
17271,uneven performances 
17272,sometimes inadequate performances 
17273,have been richer and more observant if it were less densely plotted 
17274,breathes more on the big screen 
17275,humbling little film 
17276,only thing missing 
17277,humorous and heartfelt  douglas mcgrath s version of  nicholas nickleby  
17278,are oscarsize 
17279,liked it just enough  
17280,such a welldefined sense 
17281, should nt the reality seem at least passably real  
17282,casting  often resurrecting performers who rarely work in movies now  and drawing flavorful performances from bland actors 
17283,those who are nt put off by the film s austerity will find it more than capable of rewarding them  
17284,inspiration and ambition 
17285,inexplicable nightmare 
17286,the delight of discovery 
17287,enough cool 
17288,the memorable character creations 
17289,preserves tosca s intoxicating ardor through his use of the camera 
17290,meandering  low on energy  and too eager 
17291,also captures moments of spontaneous creativity and authentic cooperative interaction 
17292,me say the obvious  abandon all hope of a good movie ye who enter here 
17293,shoplifts 
17294,assembled cliches and pabulum that plays like a 95minute commercial for nba properties  
17295,notice the 129minute running time 
17296,the movie s major and most devastating flaw is its reliance on formula  though  
17297,balk  who s finally been given a part worthy of her considerable talents 
17298,as simultaneously funny  
17299,very funny romantic comedy 
17300,the latest adam sandler assault and possibly the worst film 
17301,dip into your wallet  swipe 90 minutes of your time 
17302,when the fire burns out  we ve only come facetoface with a couple dragons and that s where the film ultimately fails  
17303,hatosy  portrays young brendan with his usual intelligence and subtlety  not to mention a convincing brogue  
17304,raucous and sappy 
17305,arrives from the margin that gives viewers a chance to learn  to grow  to travel 
17306,just a bunch of good actors flailing around in a caper that s neither original nor terribly funny  
17307,s no surprise that as a director washington demands and receives excellent performances  from himself and from newcomer derek luke 
17308,m not sure these words have ever been together in the same sentence 
17309,that was a deserved cowinner of the audience award for documentaries at the sundance film festival 
17310,in the  soontobeforgettable  section of the quirky ripoff prison 
17311,out there surrender  9 and 93 minutes of unrecoverable life 
17312,could have been crisper and punchier  but it s likely to please audiences who like movies that demand four hankies 
17313,do nt have a clue on the park  
17314,it s a long way from orwell s dark  intelligent warning cry  1984  to the empty stud knockabout of equilibrium  and 
17315,a delightful  witty  improbable romantic comedy with a zippy jazzy score 
17316,one that will have you at the edge of your seat for long stretches 
17317,a fairly enjoyable mixture of longest yard  and the 1999 guy ritchie caper lock stock and two smoking barrels  
17318,at best 
17319,the enduring strengths of women 
17320,banderas looks like he s not trying to laugh at how bad

17323,uninspiring 
17324,substitute plot for personality 
17325,not smart or 
17326,the filmmakers  paws  sad to say  
17327,to make box office money that makes michael jordan jealous 
17328,one of the lucky few who sought it out 
17329,a moving tragedy with some buoyant human moments 
17330,be killed 
17331,that stealing harvard is a horrible movie  if only it were that grand a failure 
17332,chicanery and selfdelusion 
17333,the mire of this alleged psychological thriller in search of purpose or even a plot 
17334,favor of an altogether darker side 
17335,magnetic as graham 
17336,loud and thoroughly obnoxious comedy 
17337,the big ending surprise almost saves the movie  
17338,inventive 
17339,the way this all works out makes the women look more like stereotypical caretakers and moral teachers  instead of serious athletes  
17340,but even then  i d recommend waiting for dvd and just skipping straight to her scenes  
17341,giant spider invasion comic chiller

17351,the sally jesse raphael atmosphere of films like philadelphia and american beauty 
17352,drags out 
17353,single good film 
17354,director chris wedge and screenwriters michael berg  michael j wilson and peter ackerman create some episodes that rival vintage looney tunes for the most creative mayhem in a brief amount of time  
17355,an inventive  absorbing movie that s as hard to classify as it is hard to resist  
17356,communicate the truth of the world around him 
17357,in trouble every day 
17358,do justice to the awfulness of the movie 
17359,wears you down like a dinner guest showing off his doctorate 
17360,moments of hilarity 
17361,is lightweight filmmaking  to be sure 
17362,is that  by the end  no one in the audience or the film seems to really care 
17363,an unremittingly ugly movie to look at  listen to  and think about 
17364,genuinely worthwhile 
17365,is rather pretentious 
17366,the nightmare of war 
17367,marks the spot

17378,veered off too far into the exxon zone  
17379,out on video before month s end 
17380,even bother to rent this on video 
17381,is a gentle film with dramatic punch  a haunting ode to humanity  
17382,its refusal to recognize any of the signposts  as if discovering a way through to the bitter end without a map 
17383,is offensive  puerile and unimaginatively foulmouthed if it was at least funny 
17384,avalanche 
17385,be distasteful to children and adults 
17386,everything else about it is straight from the saturday morning cartoons  a retread story  bad writing  and the same old silliness 
17387,amy and matthew have a bit of a phony relationship  but 
17388,it s impossible to even categorize this as a smutty guilty pleasure  
17389,elegant work 
17390,naiveté and sophistication 
17391,s not helpful to listen to extremist namecalling  regardless of whether you think kissinger was a calculating fiend or just a slippery selfpromoter  
17392,pleaser 
17393,what is essentially an extended soap opera 
17394,a series of riveting set pieces

17404,no solace here 
17405,can obscure this movie s lack of ideas  
17406,the beauty of alexander payne s ode to the everyman is in the details  
17407,s the little nuances that perhaps had to escape from director mark romanek s selfconscious scrutiny to happen  that finally get under your skin 
17408,s better 
17409,a divine monument 
17410,the appeal of the vulgar  sexist  racist humor went over my head or  considering just how low brow it is  perhaps it snuck under my feet

17435,recommend  
17436,stunning images and effects 
17437,a simple message 
17438,for a film that has nothing 
17439,a tendency to slip into hokum 
17440,seemingly disgusted with the lazy material and the finished product s unshapely look 
17441,one of these days hollywood will come up with an original idea for a teen movie  but 
17442,i had a serious urge to grab the old lady at the end of my aisle s walker and toss it at the screen in frustration 
17443,one of the rare directors who feels acting is the heart and soul of cinema 
17444,even when he s not at his most critically insightful 
17445,to a few rather than dozens 
17446,doltish and uneventful

17455,swimming gets the details right  from its promenade of barely clad bodies in myrtle beach  sc  to the adrenaline jolt of a sudden lunch rush at the diner  
17456,feels like a ruse  a tactic to cover up the fact that the picture is constructed around a core of flimsy  or  worse yet  nonexistent  ideas 
17457,it works its magic with such exuberance and passion that the film s length becomes a part of its fun  
17458,likable story 
17459,crafted  engaging filmmaking that should attract upscale audiences hungry for quality and a nostalgic  twisty yarn that will keep them guessing 
17460,return to neverland manages to straddle the line between another classic for the company and 
17461,in his latest effort  storytelling  solondz has finally made a movie that is nt just offensive  it also happens to be good

17477,careless and 
17478,developed 
17479,cheats on itself and retreats to comfortable territory  
17480,is an overwhelming sadness that feels as if it has made its way into your very bloodstream  
17481,shiner can certainly go the distance  but is nt world championship material 
17482,it s still a rollicking good time for the most part 
17483,would likely be most effective if used as a tool to rally anticatholic protestors  
17484,you can watch  giggle and get an adrenaline boost without feeling like you ve completely lowered your entertainment standards  
17485,shyamalan s gifts  which are such that we ll keep watching the skies for his next project

17495,talked all the way through it 
17496,good actors  good poetry and good music 
17497,are more silly than scary 
17498,is a gritty police thriller with all the dysfunctional family dynamics one could wish for 
17499,is also beautifully acted  
17500,ultimately the  yes  snaillike pacing and lack of thematic resonance make the film more silly than scary  like some sort of martha stewart decorating program run amok

17507,alienate the mainstream audience while ringing cliched to hardened indieheads

17537,it could have been something special  but two things drag it down to mediocrity  director clare peploe s misunderstanding of marivaux s rhythms  and mira sorvino s limitations as a classical actress 
17538,also represents glossy hollywood at its laziest  
17539,achieves the feel of a fanciful motion picture

17588,a good music documentary  
17589,to steal a movie not only from charismatic rising star jake gyllenhaal but also from accomplished oscar winners susan sarandon  dustin hoffman and holly hunter  yet newcomer ellen pompeo pulls off the feat with aplomb

17625,its premise is smart  but the execution is pretty weary 
17626,s also curious to note that this film  like the similarly illtimed antitrust  is easily as bad at a fraction the budget  
17627,honest observations 
17628,the film s sense of imagery gives it a terrible strength  but 
17629,where it plainly has no business going 
17630,the franchise s best years are long past

17724,see a feature that concentrates on people  a project in which the script and characters hold sway

17960,all for easy sanctimony  formulaic thrills and a hamfisted sermon on the need for national health insurance 
17961,most of the information has already appeared in one forum or another and  no matter how broomfield dresses it up  it tends to speculation  conspiracy theories or  at best  circumstantial evidence

17981,diane lane s sophisticated performance 
17982,even before it builds up to its insanely staged ballroom scene  in which 3000 actors appear in full regalia  it s waltzed itself into the art film pantheon

17984,elbowed aside by oneliners 
17985,can tell what it is supposed to be  but ca nt really call it a work of art  
17986,innocent  childlike and inherently funny

18426,horrible 
18427,the downward spiral comes to pass 
18428,shot like a postcard and overacted with all the boozy selfindulgence that brings out the worst in otherwise talented actors  
18429,s steeped in mystery and a ravishing  baroque beauty 
18430,smarter and much 
18431,beginning to resemble someone s crazy french grandfather 
18432,not only from charismatic rising star jake gyllenhaal but also from accomplished oscar winners susan sarandon  dustin hoffman and holly hunter  yet newcomer ellen pompeo pulls off the feat with aplomb 
18433,to the vast majority of more casual filmgoers  it will probably be a talky bore  
18434,sheer dumbness 
18435,a return to form for director peter bogdanovich 
18436,deeply touched by this movie 
18437,anchored by splendid performances from an honored screen veteran and a sparkling newcomer who instantly transform themselves into a believable motherdaughter pair

18439,the performances are an absolute joy  
18440,a gorgeous film  
18441,plagued by that old familiar feeling of  let s get this thing over with  
18442,a stirring time at this beautifully drawn movie

18456,humor and heart 
18457,quietly affecting cop drama 
18458,unsurprisingly  the way this all works out makes the women look more like stereotypical caretakers and moral teachers  instead of serious athletes  
18459,in some evocative shades 
18460,only need to watch for about thirty seconds before you say to yourself   ah  yes 
18461,that a subject as monstrous and pathetic as dahmer 
18462,does nt get the job done  running off the limited chemistry created by ralph fiennes and jennifer lopez  
18463,it s leaden and predictable  
18464,many of these gross 
18465,in telling the story  which is paperthin and decidedly unoriginal 
18466,seem to keep upping the ante on each other  just as their characters do in the film

18474,memorable for a peculiar malaise that renders its tension flaccid and  by extension  its surprises limp and its resolutions ritual  
18475,  safe conduct   is a long movie at 163 minutes 
18476,a supernatural mystery that does nt know whether it wants to be a suspenseful horror movie or a weepy melodrama  
18477,enticing and often funny documentary 
18478,it is very difficult to care about the character  and that is the central flaw of the film  
18479,half past dead is just such an achievement  
18480,the direction occasionally rises to the level of marginal competence  but for most of the film it is hard to tell who is chasing who or why  
18481,that watching it leaves you giddy 
18482,provide much more insight than the inside column of a torn book jacket 
18483,this loud and thoroughly obnoxious comedy about a pair of squabbling workingclass spouses

18486,all arty and jazzy 
18487,heartpounding 
18488,fail to generate any interest in an unsympathetic hero caught up in an intricate plot that while cleverly worked out  can not overcome blah characters

18490,the death of self  this orgasm  wo nt be an  exceedingly memorable one for most people 
18491,the gags are often a stitch  
18492,unusual but unfortunately also 
18493,none of this is meaningful or memorable 
18494,fantastically 
18495,all he s done is to reduce everything he touches to a shrill  didactic cartoon

18524,providing no real sense of suspense 
18525,a torrent of emotion 
18526,does no justice to the story itself 
18527,like smoke signals  the film is also imbued with strong themes of familial ties and spirituality that are powerful and moving without stooping to base melodrama 
18528,involve a dentist drill 
18529,a pitchperfect holden 
18530,a sexy slip of an earth mother who mourns her tragedies in private and embraces life in public

18543,shining with all the usual spielberg flair  
18544,ugly to look at and not a hollywood product

18551,appetizing 
18552,it s refreshing to see a romance this smart  
18553,is certainly amusing 
18554,see this terrific film with your kids 
18555,pulls back from the consequences of its own actions and revelations 
18556,the obligatory outbursts of flatulence and 
18557,curiously tepid and choppy recycling in which predictability is the only winner 
18558, manipulative and as bland as wonder bread dipped in milk  but it also does the absolute last thing we need hollywood doing to us  it preaches

18590,if you re as happy listening to movies as you are watching them  and the slow parade of human frailty fascinates you  then you re at the right film  
18591,the histrionic muse 
18592,get paid enough to sit through crap like this 
18593,s mildly interesting to ponder the peculiar american style of justice that plays out here 
18594,its loving yet unforgivingly inconsistent depiction 
18595,ultimately satisfies with its moving story 
18596,most romantic comedies  
18597,with few respites 
18598,kim kideok seems to have in mind an  emotionally at least  adolescent audience demanding regular shocks and bouts of barely defensible sexual violence to keep it interested  
18599,a tired  unnecessary retread  
18600,is clever  offbeat and even gritty enough to overcome my resistance  
18601,guys would probably be duking it out with the queen of the damned for the honor  
18602, is pleasant  diverting and modest  definitely a step in the right direction  
18603,a mostly magnificent directorial career  
18604,audience is a sea of constant smiles and frequent laughter

18615,seem bound and determined to duplicate bela lugosi s nowcliched vampire accent 
18616,most at women s expense 
18617,to its superior cast 
18618,cheap junk and 
18619,inside information 
18620,images even more haunting than those in mr spielberg s 1993 classic 
18621,supposedly authentic account of a historical event that s far too tragic to merit such superficial treatment  
18622,the right movie 
18623,too literally 
18624,has so many flaws it would be easy for critics to shred it  
18625,a flat script and 
18626, it demonstrates that werner herzog can still leave us with a sense of wonder at the diverse  marvelously twisted shapes history has taken  
18627,is delightful in the central role  
18628,fearless purity 
18629,falls victim to sloppy plotting  an insultingly unbelievable final act and a villainess who is too crazy to be interesting 
18630,beneath it 
18631,takes a potentially trite and overused concept  aliens come to earth  and infuses it into a rustic  realistic  and altogether creepy tale of hidden invasion  
18632,more elves and snow and 
18633,stiff and 
18634,is nt as funny 
18635,is high on squaddie banter  low 
18636,like the rock on a walmart budget 
18637,if it were any more of a turkey  it would gobble in dolby digital stereo  
18638,puts washington  as honest working man john q archibald  on a pedestal  then keeps lifting the pedestal higher 
18639, all credibility flies out the window  
18640,a good chance 
18641,it s a masterpiece  
18642,pass for a litmus test of the generation gap and not bad enough to repulse any generation of its fans 
18643, the château is never quite able to overcome the cultural moat surrounding its ludicrous and contrived plot   
18644,its hawaiian setting  the sciencefiction trimmings and 
18645,the leads are natural and lovely  the pace is serene  the humor wry and sprightly  
18646,catch me  feels capable of charming the masses with star power  a popinduced score and sentimental moments that have become a spielberg trademark  
18647,pointless  stupid 
18648,is repellantly out of control 
18649,it s definitely not made for kids or their parents  for that matter  
18650,to be bored by as your abc s 
18651,realize there s no place for this story to go but down 
18652,with its unflinching gaze a measure of faith in the future 
18653,it gives poor dana carvey nothing to do that is really funny 
18654, 18 million charmer 
18655,the animation and game phenomenon that peaked about three years ago is actually dying a slow death  if the poor quality of pokemon 4 ever is any indication  
18656,is painful to watch 
18657,are we dealing with dreams  visions or being told what actually happened as if it were the third ending of clue 
18658,as a story of dramatic enlightenment  the screenplay by billy ray and terry george leaves something to be desired  
18659,pushed to their most virtuous limits  
18660,sick sight 
18661,overdramatic 
18662,cheapen the overall effect 
18663,is to catch the pitch of his poetics  savor the pleasure of his sounds and images  and ponder the historical  philosophical  and ethical issues that intersect with them 
18664,is wasted in this crass  lowwattage endeavor  
18665,highlight 
18666,will ever be anything more than losers 
18667,a dashing and resourceful hero  a lisping  reptilian villain  
18668,pungent 
18669,could very well clinch him this year s razzie  
18670,a wellcrafted letdown  
18671,that its luckiest viewers will be seated next to one of those ignorant 
18672,sheridan s take on the author s schoolboy memoir  is a rather toothless take on a hard young life  
18673,the universal theme of becoming a better person through love has never been filmed more irresistibly than in  baran   
18674,angel of death 
18675,of gentle longing 
18676,cal is an unpleasantly shallow and immature character with whom to spend 110 claustrophobic minutes  
18677,it s a scorcher  
18678,an empty exercise 
18679, more of an impish divertissement of themes that interest attal and gainsbourg  they live together  the film has a lot of charm  
18680,no matter how broomfield dresses it up  it tends to speculation  conspiracy theories or  at best  circumstantial evidence 
18681,full of detail about the man and his country  and is well worth seeing 
18682,the genre and another firstrate performance 
18683,falls under the category of  should have been a sketch on saturday night live   
18684,s the kind of effectively creepyscary thriller that has you fixating on a far corner of the screen at times because your nerves just ca nt take it any more 
18685,visually transforms the dreary expanse of deadend distaste the characters inhabit into a poem of art  music and metaphor  
18686,often funny 
18687,formal settings with motionless characters 
18688,of any opportunity for finding meaning in relationships or work 
18689, metropolis never seems hopelessly juvenile  
18690,predominantly amateur cast is painful to watch  
18691,likable movie 
18692,an ugly  revolting movie 
18693,it turns out to be significantly different  and better  than most films with this theme 
18694,the best brush 
18695,an uneven mix of dark satire and childhood awakening 
18696,that falls far short of the peculiarly moral amorality of  woo s  best work 
18697,a wretched movie that reduces the second world war to one man 
18698,soulless and  even more damning  virtually joyless 
18699,that rare creature  
18700,is smarter and subtler 
18701,stanzas of breathtaking  aweinspiring visual poetry 
18702,to waste their time 
18703,that might have required genuine acting from ms spears 
18704,is one of the biggest disappointments of the year 
18705,my ribcage did nt ache by the end of kung pow 
18706,you ve got a place in your heart for smokey robinson 
18707,worth a look as a curiosity  
18708,an unsettling sight  and indicative of his  if you will  outofkilter character  
18709,spontaneity in its execution and 
18710,where big stars and high production values are standard procedure 
18711,never feels derivative 
18712,lacks it 
18713,stop watching 
18714,is smart 
18715,of the theater 
18716,this  meandering and pointless french comingofage import from writerdirector annesophie birot 
18717,good intentions leads to the video store 
18718,a fine effort  
18719,s a riot to see rob schneider in a young woman s clothes 
18720,does a splendid job of racial profiling hollywood style  casting excellent latin actors of all ages  a trend long overdue  
18721,magnificent swooping aerial shots 
18722,smarter than its commercials make it seem  
18723,i love the opening scenes of a wintry new york city in 1899  
18724,just zings along with vibrance and warmth  
18725,is simply not enough of interest onscreen 
18726,a deliciously nonsensical comedy about a city coming apart at its seams  
18727,the writing is clever 
18728,a tiresome cliché 
18729,that between the son and his wife  and the wife and the father  and between the two brothers  with incredible subtlety and acumen 
18730,an indepth portrait of an iconoclastic artist 
18731,disreputable 
18732,terrific 
18733,speculative effort 
18734,like a cheap lawn chair 
18735,one of the most plain  unimaginative romantic comedies i 
18736,screwball farce and bloodcurdling family intensity on one continuum 
18737,readymade midnight movie 
18738,s about as convincing as any other arnie musclefest  but has a little too much resonance with real world events and ultimately comes off as insultingly simplistic 
18739,intoxicating atmosphere and 
18740,rarely has skin looked as beautiful  desirable  even delectable  as it does in trouble every day  
18741,its overall sense of mystery 
18742,his greatest triumph is keeping the creepy crawlies hidden in the film s thick shadows 
18743,while there are times when the film s reach exceeds its grasp  the production works more often than it does nt  
18744,creates images even more haunting than those in mr spielberg s 1993 classic 
18745,there is a certain sense of experimentation and improvisation to this film that may not always work 
18746,visually compelling 
18747,recognizes the needs of moviegoers for real characters and compelling plots 
18748,brought me uncomfortably close to losing my lunch  
18749,to be a collection taken for the comedian at the end of the show 
18750,better script 
18751,is clear  not easily and  in the end  not well enough 
18752,a small movie 
18753,a really strong second effort 
18754,in artful  watery tones of blue  green and brown 
18755,silly subplots 
18756,that s always fun to watch 
18757,appropriate ferocity and thoughtfulness 
18758, spiderman  certainly delivers the goods

18761,difficulty 
18762,tolerance and diversity 
18763,emotionally strong

18767,cinematic intoxication 
18768,by false sentiment or sharp  overmanipulative hollywood practices 
18769,three sides of his story with a sensitivity and an inquisitiveness reminiscent of truffaut 
18770,mira nair s film is an absolute delight for all audiences 
18771,of these young women 
18772,a largerthanlife figure  an artist who has been awarded mythic status in contemporary culture 
18773,stodgy 
18774,if the director  tom dey  had spliced together bits and pieces of midnight run and 48 hours  and  for that matter  shrek  
18775,s a spontaneity to the chateau  a sense of lightheartedness  that makes it attractive throughout  
18776,is depressing  ruthlessly pained and depraved 
18777, then knock yourself out and enjoy the big screen postcard that is a selfglorified martin lawrence lovefest  
18778,affirming  
18779,that takes full  chilling advantage of its rougharoundtheedges  lowbudget constraints

18786,of bright young men  promising  talented  charismatic and tragically 
18787,that manages to find greatness in the hue of its drastic iconography 
18788,most of the pitfalls you d expect in such a potentially sudsy setup 
18789,goes out into public  to avoid being recognized as the man who bilked unsuspecting moviegoers 
18790, pray does nt have a passion for the material

18795,is enormously good fun 
18796,represents the depths to which the girlsbehavingbadly film has fallen 
18797,the absurdity of the premise 
18798,an extraordinary poignancy 
18799,was feeling this movie until it veered off too far into the exxon zone  and left me behind at the station looking for a return ticket to realism  
18800,if you re going to subjugate truth to the tearjerking demands of soap opera 
18801,lacks the spirit of the previous two  and makes all those jokes about hos and even more unmentionable subjects seem like mere splashing around in the muck  
18802,feels more like the pilot episode of a tv series 
18803,ca nt wait to see what the director does next 
18804,passionate and 
18805,the film is way too full of itself  it s stuffy and pretentious in a givemeanoscar kind of way

18808,the mediocre end 
18809,denzel washington s fine performance

18812,a casual intelligence that permeates the script 
18813,perfectly clear 
18814,ben kingsley is truly funny  playing a kind of ghandi gone bad  
18815,every suspenseful cliché in the book 
18816,getting the better of obnoxious adults 
18817,s still not a good movie 
18818,is nt as sharp as the original  despite some visual virtues   blade ii  just does nt cut it  
18819,it s hard to say who might enjoy this  are there tolstoy groupies out there  
18820,outpaces its contemporaries with daring and verve 
18821,splendidlooking as this particular film 
18822,resistance and artistic transcendence 
18823, witty  improbable romantic comedy 
18824,what they see in each other also is difficult to fathom  
18825,that mel gibson can gasp  shudder and even tremble without losing his machismo 
18826,absolutely 
18827,it s packed with adventure and a worthwhile environmental message  so it s great for the kids 
18828, the film  works  due mostly to the tongueincheek attitude of the screenplay  
18829,but it will just as likely make you weep  and it will do so in a way that does nt make you feel like a sucker  
18830,something to be taken seriously 
18831,s so devoid of joy and energy it makes even jason x  look positively shakesperean by comparison 
18832,the mundane 
18833, god help us  but capra and cooper are rolling over in their graves   
18834,allows each character to confront their problems openly and honestly  
18835,feels like the work of someone who may indeed have finally aged past his prime  and  perhaps more than he realizes  
18836,takes off in totally unexpected directions 
18837,manipulative and as bland 
18838,is so convincing that by movies  end you ll swear you are wet in some places and feel sand creeping in others  
18839,that the final product is a ghost 
18840,notwithstanding my problem with the movie s final half hour  i m going to recommend secretary  based on the wonderful acting clinic put on by spader and gyllenhaal  
18841,having been recycled more times than i d care to count 
18842,no palpable chemistry between lopez and male lead ralph fiennes 
18843,the soggy performances 
18844,as the filmmakers look down on their workingclass subjects from their lofty perch  that finally makes sex with strangers  which opens today in the new york metropolitan area  so distasteful 
18845, or  worse yet  nonexistent  ideas 
18846,a strongminded viewpoint  or a sense of humor 
18847,from the ages 
18848,makes you believe the cast and crew thoroughly enjoyed themselves and believed in their smallbudget film  
18849,a plethora of engaging diatribes 
18850, hypocritical 
18851,the modern master of the chase sequence returns with a chase to end all chases 
18852,crisp framing  edgy camera work 
18853,the flat dialogue by vincent r nebrida 
18854,is hard to tell who is chasing who or why 
18855,been hoping for 
18856,reminds us of our own responsibility 
18857,robert rodriguez adorns his familyfilm plot with an elegance and maturity that even most contemporary adult movies are lacking  
18858,uncool the only thing missing is the  gadzooks   
18859,the first shocking thing about sorority boys is that it s actually watchable  
18860,exhilarating  
18861,where janice beard falters in its recycled aspects  implausibility  and sags in pace  it rises in its courageousness  and comedic employment  
18862,it s a familiar story  but one that is presented with great sympathy and intelligence  
18863,check your pulse  
18864, humorous  illuminating study 
18865,highspirited buddy movie 
18866,the hand that has finally  to some extent  warmed up to him 
18867,a fun 
18868,sleazy moralizing 
18869,is shallow  offensive and redundant  with pitifully few real laughs 
18870,large budget notwithstanding  the movie is such a blip on the year s radar screen that it s tempting just to go with it for the ride  
18871,heartwarming and gently comic even as the film breaks your heart  
18872,that is more accurate than anything i have seen in an american film 
18873,gets around to its real emotional business  
18874,hey  happy  
18875,to see this terrific film with your kids  if you do nt have kids borrow some 
18876,clever and very satisfying picture 
18877,the humor aspects of  jason x  were far more entertaining than i had expected 
18878,amusing  sad and reflective 
18879,d watch these two together again in a new york minute  
18880,most interesting 
18881,great performances  stylish cinematography and a gritty feel help 
18882,derivative  overlong  and bombastic  
18883,ca nt rescue adrian lyne s unfaithful from its sleazy moralizing  
18884,fused with solid performances and eerie atmosphere 
18885,it appears not to have been edited at all 
18886,never quite achieves the feel of a fanciful motion picture  
18887,delicate 
18888,s not just a feelgood movie 
18889,leaden 
18890,goes bump in the night and nobody cares 
18891,that unfolds with grace and humor and gradually 
18892,that s neither completely enlightening  nor 
18893,15 years old 
18894,good things 
18895, chilling and heartwarming 
18896, elegant technology for the masses  
18897,no psychology here  and no real narrative logic  
18898,average bond 
18899,indoor drama 
18900,quite funny 
18901,to inhale this gutter romancer s secondhand material 
18902, washington s  strong hand  keen eye  sweet spirit and good taste 
18903,low rate annie 
18904,narrative grace 
18905,as boring before i see this piece of crap again 
18906,are disjointed  flaws that have to be laid squarely on taylor s doorstep  
18907,in its crapulence 
18908,kouyate elicits strong performances from his cast  
18909,a film neither bitter nor sweet  neither romantic nor comedic  neither warm nor fuzzy  
18910,s not original enough 
18911,parapsychological 
18912,carried out 
18913,is a shaky  uncertain film that nevertheless touches a few raw nerves 
18914,a catastrophic collision of tastelessness and gall 
18915,most of jaglom s selfconscious and gratingly irritating films 
18916,standard thriller and drag audience enthusiasm 
18917,it also happens to be good 
18918,put together with the preteen boy in mind  
18919,welldefined sense 
18920,biggie and tupac is undeniably subversive and involving in its bold presentation  
18921,as a film director  labute continues to improve  
18922,throws away the goodwill the first half of his movie generates by orchestrating a finale that is impenetrable and dull 
18923,will please eastwood s loyal fans 
18924,to his people 
18925,of its inventiveness 
18926,an oldfashioned drama of substance about a teacher 
18927,the forced funniness found in the dullest kiddie flicks 
18928,watch witherspoon s talents wasting away inside unnecessary films like legally blonde and sweet home abomination  i mean  
18929,eventual cult classic 
18930,touches the heart and the funnybone thanks to the energetic and always surprising performance 
18931,this terrific film 
18932,the shabby digital photography 
18933,it s soulful and unslick  and that s apparently just what  aniston  has always needed to grow into a movie career 
18934,an exit sign  that is  
18935,lacks juice and delight 
18936,confessions is without a doubt a memorable directorial debut from king hunk  
18937,by which all the queen s men is allegedly  inspired  was a lot funnier and more deftly enacted than what s been cobbled together onscreen 
18938,calculating fiend 
18939,has been written so well  that even a simple  goddammit   
18940,in all  a great party 
18941,this quality band 
18942,pretentious  
18943,distinguishable 
18944,in such a lousy way  complete with some of the year s  unintentionally  funniest moments  that it s impossible to care 
18945,every individual will see the movie through the prism of his or her own beliefs and prejudices 
18946,the worst possibilities of mankind 
18947,for a bad film 
18948,a satisfying destination 
18949,ate a reeses 
18950,a marvelous performance by allison lohman as an identityseeking foster child  
18951,draws us in long 
18952,the nightmare 
18953,riveting documentary  
18954,entertaining feature 
18955,pt anderson understands the grandness of romance and 
18956,it chiefly inspires you to drive a little faster 
18957, violent and mindless 
18958,black hawk down with more heart 
18959,it s fun  splashy and entertainingly nasty  
18960,if downbeat  
18961,just the sort of disposable  kitchensink homage that illustrates why the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts in today s hollywood 
18962,very good 
18963,wilson and murphy show how funny they could have been in a more ambitious movie 
18964,be missing a great deal of the acerbic repartee of the play 
18965,lovely toward the end 
18966,think of a film more cloyingly sappy than evelyn 
18967,that the new film is a lame kiddie flick and that carvey s considerable talents are wasted in it 
18968,this filmmaker s flailing reputation 
18969,from largely flat and uncreative moments 
18970,that steal your heart away 
18971,bad at a fraction the budget 
18972,interesting social parallel and defiant aesthetic 
18973,on and on to the point of nausea 
18974,lacks balance  and fails to put the struggle into meaningful historical context  
18975,endear itself 
18976,of those unassuming films that sneaks up on you and stays with you long after you have left the theater 
18977,is fantastic 
18978,the film is  at its core  deeply pessimistic or quietly hopeful 
18979,because it has a biggername cast 
18980,the high standards 
18981,broomfield has a rather unique approach to documentary  
18982,inescapable absurdities 
18983,of outrageous force and craven concealment 
18984,is capped with pointless extremes 
18985,clever  offbeat and even gritty enough 
18986,vivid  convincing performances 
18987,love  longing  
18988,s truly awful and heartbreaking subject matter  but one whose lessons are well worth revisiting as many times as possible 
18989,transcend genre 
18990,deftly captures 
18991,if the film s vision of sport as a secular religion is a bit cloying  its throughline of family and community is heartening in the same way that each season marks a new start  
18992,high standards 
18993,its clumsiness 
18994, it is a great film  
18995,even elizabeth hurley seem graceless and ugly 
18996,me uncomfortably close to losing my lunch 
18997,in its recycled aspects  implausibility  and sags in pace 
18998,thanks to the presence 
18999,a completely spooky piece of business that gets under your skin and  some plot blips aside  stays there for the duration  
19000,forgets about her other obligations  leading to a tragedy which is somehow guessable from the first few minutes  maybe because it echoes the by now intolerable morbidity of so many recent movies  
19001,genre a bad name 
19002,the only surprise is that heavyweights joel silver and robert zemeckis agreed to produce this  i assume the director has pictures of them cavorting in ladies  underwear  
19003,my least favorite emotions  especially when i have to put up with 146 minutes of it 
19004,there are some laughs in this movie 
19005,just does nt have big screen magic 
19006,mounted  exasperatingly wellbehaved film  which ticks off kahlo s lifetime milestones with the dutiful precision of a tax accountant 
19007,potent exploration 
19008,schnieder bounces around with limp wrists  wearing tight tummy tops and hip huggers  twirling his hair on his finger and assuming that s enough to sustain laughs  
19009,can fully succeed at cheapening it  
19010,it with ring  an indisputably spooky film 
19011,the sweetest thing leaves a bitter taste  
19012,does little here but point at things that explode into flame 
19013,unholy 
19014,as immediate as the latest news footage from gaza and  because of its heightened  wellshaped dramas  twice as powerful 
19015,often demented in a good way  
19016,capra and cooper are rolling over in their graves 
19017,4ever is neither a promise nor a threat so much as wishful thinking  
19018,an extremely flat lead performance 
19019,this is dicaprio s best performance in anything ever  and easily the most watchable film of the year  
19020,is almost entirely witless and inane  
19021,is worse 
19022,own idiosyncratic way 
19023,the movie will likely set the cause of woman warriors back decades  
19024,rich and 
19025,has a welldeserved reputation as one of the cinema world s great visual stylists 
19026,typical toback machinations 
19027,creepycrawly bug things that live only in the darkness 
19028,enormous feeling 
19029,an infinitely wittier version 
19030,takes great pleasure in watching the resourceful molly stay a step ahead of her pursuers  
19031,creative film 
19032,singularly offputting romantic comedy  
19033,anteing up some movie star charisma 
19034,ll feel like you ate a reeses without the peanut butter 
19035,does nt add anything fresh to the myth  
19036,good spirits 
19037,the nonconformist in us 
19038,blandness 
19039,finds one of our most conservative and hidebound moviemaking traditions and gives it new texture  new relevance  new reality  
19040,shift 
19041,admire it and yet can not recommend it  because it overstays its natural running time  
19042,made off with your wallet 
19043,the art demands live viewing  
19044,heartening in the same way 
19045,you know the picture is in trouble  
19046,more goodies 
19047,japan s wildest filmmaker gives us a crime fighter carrying more emotional baggage than batman  
19048,subtlety and acumen 
19049,the stills might make a nice coffee table book

19053,wiseman s warmest 
19054,captivating as the rowdy participants think it is 
19055,behind cutesy film references 
19056, i have given this movie a rating of zero  
19057,if you go  pack your knitting needles  
19058,a witty  lowkey romantic comedy 
19059,is very choppy and monosyllabic despite the fact that it is being dubbed  
19060,many excesses 
19061,mexico s most colorful and controversial artists 
19062,a modicum of patience 
19063,for the toilet and scores a direct hit 
19064, based on true events   a convolution of language that suggests it s impossible to claim that it is  based on a true story  with a straight face  
19065,distinguish one scifi work 
19066,at little kids but with plenty of entertainment value 
19067,idemoto and kim make a gorgeous pair  their scenes brim with sexual possibility and emotional danger 
19068,its compelling mix of trial movie  escape movie and unexpected fable 
19069,like a mediumgrade network sitcom  mostly inoffensive 
19070,trying to make head or tail of the story in the hiphop indie snipes is enough to give you brain strain  and the payoff is negligible  
19071,they just do nt work in concert  
19072,even a story immersed in love  lust  and sin could nt keep my attention 
19073,is on his way to becoming the american indian spike lee 
19074,a haunting sense of malaise 
19075,happy  heady jumble 
19076, it s really unclear why this project was undertaken 
19077,lost in the  soontobeforgettable  section of the quirky ripoff prison romp pile 
19078,aimed mainly at little kids but with plenty of entertainment value 
19079,combined with stunning animation  
19080,added disdain

19087,competent performers 
19088,grueling 
19089,tv cop show cliches 
19090,both a level of sophisticated intrigue and humanscale characters that suck the audience in 
19091,to please its intended audience  children  without placing their parents in a comalike state 
19092,that shows its indie tatters and selfconscious seams in places  but has some quietly moving moments and an intelligent subtlety 
19093,works  mostly due to its superior cast 
19094,a good oldfashioned adventure 
19095,or  worse yet  nonexistent  
19096,scotland  pa would be forgettable if it were nt such a clever adaptation of the bard s tragic play  
19097,with grace and humor and 
19098,a director who understands how to create and sustain a mood 
19099,falls short on tension  eloquence  spiritual challenge  things that have made the original new testament stories so compelling for 20 centuries 
19100,you ll wait in vain for a movie to happen  
19101,a remarkably cohesive whole  
19102,slack complacency 
19103,is the piece works brilliantly  
19104,minimal appreciation 
19105,lacking the real talent and wit to elevate it beyond its formula to the level of classic romantic comedy to which it aspires 
19106,even better 
19107, the film shows signs that someone other than the director got into the editing room and tried to improve things by making the movie go faster  
19108,episode ii  attack of the clones is a technological exercise that lacks juice and delight  
19109,ice age wo nt drop your jaw  but it will warm your heart  and i m giving it a strong thumbs up 
19110,these people 
19111, the road paved with good intentions leads to the video store  
19112,oldfashioned but thoroughly satisfying entertainment 
19113,reason to go 
19114,of a callow rich boy who is forced to choose between his beautiful  selfsatisfied 22yearold girlfriend and an equally beautiful  selfsatisfied 18yearold mistress 
19115,cheesy dialogue 
19116,is meaningless  vapid and devoid of substance  
19117,is both a snore and utter tripe  
19118,is confused in death to smoochy into something both ugly and mindless 
19119,of a selfdestructive man 
19120,i last walked out on a movie

19122,delightfully cheeky 
19123,a thriller with an edge

19125,an ease in front of the camera 
19126,noisy and 
19127,with attractive men 
19128,straining to get by on humor that is not even as daring as john ritter s glory days on three s company 
19129,enjoyable  if occasionally flawed  experiment 
19130,unclean 
19131,a portrait of alienation so perfect 
19132,overwhelming pleasure 
19133,lousy movie 
19134,of the dry humor that first made audiences on both sides of the atlantic love him 
19135,teaming 
19136,is found in its ability to spoof both black and white stereotypes equally 
19137,made up for its rather slow beginning 
19138,quite the genrebusting film 
19139,guess why the cast and crew did nt sign a pact to burn the negative and the script and pretend the whole thing never existed 
19140,episodic choppiness  undermining the story s emotional thrust 
19141,as you watch them clumsily mugging their way through snow dogs  
19142,what punk 
19143,the sentimental ohthosewackybrits genre that was ushered in by the full monty and is still straining to produce another smash 
19144,a superfluous sequel  plagued by that old familiar feeling of  let s get this thing over with   everyone has shown up at the appointed time and place  but 
19145,of childhood innocence combined with indoctrinated prejudice 
19146,of more selfabsorbed women than the mother and daughters featured in this film 
19147,love the robust middle of this picture 
19148,filled with more holes than clyde barrow s car 
19149,sneering humor 
19150, you have to give the audience a reason to want to put for that effort 
19151,of how horrible we are to ourselves and each other 
19152,everybody  wan na watch a movie in which a guy dressed as a children s party clown gets violently gangraped  
19153,most daring  and 
19154,ultimate x is the gabbiest giantscreen movie ever  bogging down in a barrage of hype

19159,thought the relationships were wonderful 
19160,combines the enigmatic features of  memento  with the hallucinatory drug culture of  requiem for a dream 
19161,us  is a man who uses the damage of war  far more often than the warfare itself  to create the kind of art shots that fill gallery shows 
19162,the film runs on a little longer than it needs to  muccino either does nt notice when his story ends or just ca nt tear himself away from the characters  but 
19163,of character portrait  romantic comedy and beattheclock thriller 
19164,a heady  biting  bebop ride through nighttime manhattan  a loquacious videologue of the modern male and the lengths to which he ll go to weave a protective cocoon around his own ego

19170,while it forces you to ponder anew what a movie can be 
19171,the script boasts some tart tvinsider humor  but the film has not a trace of humanity or empathy  
19172,artistic aspirations 
19173,infamy 
19174,swimming is above all about a young woman s face  and by casting an actress whose face projects that woman s doubts and yearnings

19201,a heroine as feisty and 
19202,romp of a film 
19203,deserving of its critical backlash and more  
19204,a flashy editing style

19223,more spirit and bite than your average formulaic romantic quadrangle 
19224,moving in many directions as it searches  vainly  i think  for something fresh to say 
19225,a shame that stealing harvard is too busy getting in its own way to be anything but frustrating  boring  and forgettable  
19226,an undeniably moving film to experience  and ultimately that s what makes it worth a recommendation  
19227,takes every potential laugh and stilettostomps the life out of it

19251,formidable arithmetic 
19252,distinctly subpar  more likely to drown a viewer in boredom than to send any shivers down his spine 
19253,for this sensuous and spirited tale of a prim widow who finds an unlikely release in bellydancing clubs 
19254,so appealing about the characters

19270,slow and ponderous  but rohmer s drama builds to an intense indoor drama about compassion  sacrifice  and christian love in the face of political corruption

19300,all its excess debris 
19301,mind to see a feature that concentrates on people  a project in which the script and characters hold sway 
19302,amid the shock and curiosity factors  the film is just a corny examination of a young actress trying to find her way  
19303,one of the most genuinely sweet films to come along in quite some time  
19304,to stodgy  soap operaish dialogue 
19305,much of it is funny

19328,watch a movie in which a guy dressed as a children s party clown gets violently gangraped  
19329,quiet family drama 
19330, the film  tackles the topic of relationships in such a straightforward  emotionally honest manner that by the end  it s impossible to ascertain whether the film is  at its core  deeply pessimistic or quietly hopeful  
19331,is that it s a brazenly misguided project 
19332,vaguely interesting 
19333,tickles the funny bone

19358,beating the austin powers films at their own game  this blaxploitation spoof downplays the raunch in favor of gags that rely on the strength of their own cleverness as opposed to the extent of their outrageousness  
19359,starts out with tremendous promise  introducing an intriguing and alluring premise  only to fall prey to a boatload of screenwriting cliches that sink it faster than a leaky freighter  
19360,a good deal funnier than his original

20025,captures an italian immigrant family on the brink of major changes 
20026,that they are doing it is thoughtprovoking  
20027,the bad sound  the lack of climax and  worst of all  
20028,the thornier aspects 
20029,of cliches 
20030,are fun and reminiscent of combat scenes from the star wars series  
20031,puts the sting back into the con

20035,to absurd lengths 
20036,absurdities and clichés 
20037,a beautiful  timeless and universal tale of heated passions 
20038, is entertaining  
20039,does nt know if it wants to be a retrorefitting exercise in campy recall for older fans or a silly  nickelodeonesque kiddie flick  
20040,oddly honest 
20041,visually breathtaking  viscerally exciting  and dramatically moving  it s the very definition of epic adventure  
20042,less of a trifle if ms sugarman followed through on her defiance of the saccharine 
20043,in my own very humble opinion  in praise of love lacks even the most fragmented charms i have found in almost all of his previous works  
20044,its 112minute length 
20045,drifts aimlessly for 90 minutes before lodging in the cracks of that evergrowing category 
20046,little too ponderous to work as shallow entertainment  not remotely incisive enough to qualify as drama  monsoon wedding

20073,imponderably stilted and selfconsciously arty 
20074,has a flair for dialogue comedy 
20075,lies a plot cobbled together from largely flat and uncreative moments 
20076,fits into a genre that has been overexposed  redolent of a thousand cliches  and yet remains uniquely itself  vibrant with originality 
20077,watching a rerun 
20078,the enjoyable undercover brother  a zany mix of saturday night livestyle parody  70s blaxploitation films and goofball action comedy gone wild  
20079,masochism 
20080,the uneven movie does have its charms and its funny moments but not quite enough of them  
20081,as the slight  pale mr broomfield continues to force himself on people and into situations that would make lesser men run for cover 
20082,this is a film about the irksome  tiresome nature of complacency that remains utterly satisfied to remain the same throughout  
20083,frequent flurries of creative belly laughs 
20084,to become a majorleague leading lady   but  
20085,loud  silly  stupid and pointless  
20086,a simple tale of an unlikely friendship  but thanks to the gorgeous locales and exceptional lead performances  it has considerable charm

20094,major pleasures 
20095,sick and demented humor 
20096,should appreciate its whimsical humor 
20097,humanly funny film 
20098,is a frustrating patchwork  an uneasy marriage of louis begley s source novel  about schmidt  and an old payne screenplay  
20099,a funny  puzzling movie ambiguous enough to be engaging and oddly moving 
20100,truly distinctive 
20101,is a remake by the numbers  linking a halfwit plot to a series of standup routines in which wilson and murphy show how funny they could have been in a more ambitious movie  
20102,a lovely  eerie film that casts an odd  rapt spell 
20103,an intelligent  realistic portrayal of testing boundaries

20129,sharper  cleaner script

20155,to recycle images and characters that were already tired 10 years ago 
20156,a fully engaged supporting cast 
20157,lowrent  and even lowerwit 
20158, is a shapeless inconsequential move relying on the viewer to do most of the work

20165,has a wooden delivery and encounters a substantial arc of change that does nt produce any real transformation  
20166,if you open yourself up to mr reggio s theory of this imagery as the movie s set  it can impart an almost visceral sense of dislocation and change  
20167,cram too many ingredients 
20168,great material for a film  rowdy  brawny and lyrical in the best irish sense 
20169,what redeems the film is the cast  particularly the yayas themselves

20196,interested 
20197,a worthwhile documentary  
20198,pedestrian

20267,contradiction 
20268,trudge 
20269,in many ways the perfect festival film  a calm  selfassured portrait of small town regret  love  duty and friendship that appeals to the storytelling instincts of a slightly more literate filmgoing audience 
20270,do nt have the slightest difficulty accepting him in the role 
20271,yu clearly hopes to camouflage how bad his movie is  
20272,in fact  the best in recent memory

20286,thirteen conversations about one thing is a small gem  
20287,but its storytelling prowess and special effects are both listless

20302,ludicrous and contrived plot 
20303, it s a pretty good execution of a story that s a lot richer than the ones hollywood action screenwriters usually come up with on their own  
20304,probably limited to lds church members and undemanding armchair tourists 
20305,cruel and inhuman cinematic punishment 
20306,gets bogged down over 140 minutes 
20307,started with a great premise and then just fell apart

20315,the characters sound like real people 
20316,standout performance 
20317,comatose 
20318, warm water under a red bridge is a celebration of feminine energy  a tribute to the power of women to heal  
20319,an inspired portrait of maleridden angst and the emotional blockage that accompanies this human condition 
20320,novak contemplates a heartland so overwhelmed by its lack of purpose that it seeks excitement in manufactured high drama

20324,fearlessly gets under the skin of the people involved 
20325,hugely imaginative and successful casting to its great credit 
20326,mined his personal horrors and came up with a treasure chest of material 
20327,the answer is as conventional as can be 
20328,human nature  in short  is nt nearly as funny as it thinks it is  neither is it as smart 
20329,recommend it 
20330,the charisma and ability 
20331,uneven 
20332,so lackluster

20334,never again  while nothing special  is pleasant  diverting and modest  definitely a step in the right direction  
20335,is its essential problem 
20336,caffeinated  sloppy brilliance 
20337,what the audience feels is exhaustion  from watching a movie that is dark  dark green  to be exact   sour  bloody and mean

20339,the sentimental cliches mar an otherwise excellent film  
20340,being dragged through a sad  sordid universe of guns  drugs  avarice and damaged dreams 
20341,the screenplay  but rather 
20342,for independence  complete with loads of cgi and bushels of violence  but not a drop of human blood 
20343,we get a cinematic postcard that s superficial and unrealized  
20344,remains the most wondrous of all hollywood fantasies  and the apex of steven spielberg s misunderstood career  
20345,a nasty aftertaste but little clear memory 
20346,a little oldfashioned storytelling 
20347,s a heaven for bad movies 
20348,the biggest names in japanese anime 
20349,rushed  slapdash

20362,as if it belongs on the big screen 
20363,the production details are lavish 
20364,mr goyer s loose  unaccountable direction 
20365,an ultraloud blast of pointless mayhem  going nowhere fast 
20366,as actionadventure  this spacebased homage to robert louis stevenson s treasure island fires on all plasma conduits

20370,these people are really going to love the piano teacher  
20371,should get all five 
20372,hackery 
20373,but if the essence of magic is its makebelieve promise of life that soars above the material realm  this is the opposite of a truly magical movie  
20374,the point of nausea 
20375,realizes a fullness that does not negate the subject  
20376,be of interest primarily to its target audience 
20377,blast even the smallest sensitivities from the romance 
20378,just as the lousy tarantino imitations have subsided 
20379,going at a rapid pace  occasionally using an omniscient voiceover narrator in the manner of french new wave films 
20380,deserves  at the very least  
20381,its throughline of family and community is heartening in the same way that each season marks a new start

20385,delicious  quirky movie 
20386,everyone s insecure in lovely and amazing  a poignant and wryly amusing film about mothers  daughters and their relationships  
20387,any film that does nt even in passing mention political prisoners  poverty and the boat loads of people who try to escape the country 
20388,emptiness and maddeningly sedate pacing 
20389,it s not particularly well made 
20390, and unforgettable characters 
20391,a sad  soggy potboiler 
20392,the overall fabric is hypnotic  and 
20393,also is difficult to fathom  
20394,busts out of its comfy little cell 
20395,that hews out a world and carries us effortlessly from darkness to light 
20396,companion 
20397,the rueful  wry humor springing out of yiddish culture and language 
20398,through the constraints of its source 
20399,laughs in this simple  sweet and romantic comedy 
20400,aimless for much of its running time  
20401,the superficial tensions 
20402,the charm of satin rouge 
20403,that it looks neat 
20404,across as shallow and glib though 
20405,after several scenes of this tacky nonsense 
20406,you re left with a sour taste in your mouth

20418,well spent 
20419,engrossing piece 
20420,taboo 
20421,lame and sophomoric 
20422, my mind kept returning to one anecdote for comparison  the cartoon in japan that gave people seizures  
20423,a remarkably faithful one 
20424,the appeal of the vulgar  sexist  racist humor went over my head or  considering just how low brow it is 
20425,the cast  keeps this pretty watchable  and casting mick jagger as director of the escort service was inspired 
20426,a superior crime movie 
20427,may rethink their attitudes when they see the joy the characters take in this creed 
20428, a formula comedy redeemed by its stars  
20429,s hard to imagine any recent film  independent or otherwise  that makes as much of a mess as this one  
20430,whether we re supposed to shriek 
20431,gives it that extra little something that makes it worth checking out at theaters 
20432,showtime is nevertheless efficiently amusing for a good while

20585,the peak of all things insipid

20630,shot largely in small rooms  the film has a gentle  unforced intimacy that never becomes claustrophobic

21013, it has sporadic bursts of liveliness  some soso slapstick and a few earpleasing songs on its soundtrack

21143, the kid s  just too bratty for sympathy  and as the film grows to its finale  his little changes ring hollow 
21144,the film has a laundry list of minor shortcomings  but the numerous scenes of gory mayhem are worth the price of admission  if  gory mayhem  is your idea of a good time

21237,to let the earnestness of its execution and skill of its cast take you down a familiar road with a few twists 
21238,easily and  in the end  not well enough 
21239,much colorful eye candy

21429, clarity and emotional 
21430, crazy  
21431,melodrama and tiresome love triangles 
21432,fessenden s narrative is just as much about the ownership and redefinition of myth as it is about a domestic unit finding their way to joy  
21433,overall tomfoolery like this is a matter of taste  
21434,visceral and 
21435,rotten in almost every single facet of production that you ll want to crawl up your own  in embarrassment

21474,carries much of the film with a creepy and deadon performance  
21475,just ca nt take it any more 
21476,the silly spy vs spy film the sum of all fears  starring ben affleck  seem downright hitchcockian 
21477,can not sustain the buoyant energy level of the film s city beginnings into its country conclusion  
21478,mindless 
21479,selfdestructiveness

21483,absolutely  inescapably gorgeous  skyscrapertrapeze motion of the amazing spiderman 
21484,fans of plympton s shorts may marginally enjoy the film  but 
21485,a part of us that can not help be entertained by the sight of someone getting away with something 
21486,that spends a bit too much time on its fairly ludicrous plot 
21487,canny  meditative 
21488,the picture begins to resemble the shapeless  grasping actors  workshop that it is  
21489,but first  you have to give the audience a reason to want to put for that effort 
21490,a movie that will make you laugh 
21491,interesting characters 
21492,as the movie dragged on  i thought i heard a mysterious voice  and felt myself powerfully drawn toward the light  the light of the exit sign  
21493,overwhelm what is left of the scruffy  dopey old hannabarbera charm

21495,once overly oldfashioned in its sudsy 
21496,in conveying its social message 
21497,director charles stone iii applies more detail to the film s music than to the story line

21499,you are wet in some places 
21500,helljaunt 
21501,allows a gawky actor like spall  who could too easily become comic relief in any other film  
21502,conceptually brilliant  plays like a livingroom war of the worlds  gaining most of its unsettling force from the suggested and the unknown  
21503,we believe in them

21505, lacks in depth 
21506,achieves its main strategic objective

21509,racist 
21510,want to get madeup and go see this movie with my sisters 
21511,insanely funny 
21512,has appeal beyond being a sandra bullock vehicle or a standard romantic comedy  
21513,a much more successful translation than its most famous previous film adaptation 
21514,the lines work 
21515,nelson s intentions are good  but the end result does no justice to the story itself 
21516,quite able 
21517,s not only dull 
21518,a crowdpleaser 
21519,nary a glimmer of selfknowledge 
21520, even more damning  
21521,far more stylish 
21522,dedicated 
21523,full frontal  which opens today nationwide  could almost be classified as a movieindustry satire  but it lacks the generous inclusiveness that is the genre s definitive  if disingenuous  feature  
21524,shines 
21525,a psychic journey deep into the very fabric of iranian  
21526,that tries too hard to be emotional 
21527,what a reckless squandering of four fine 
21528,rollicking dark humor 
21529,the actors are simply too good  and the story too intriguing  
21530,and neither do cliches  no matter how  inside  they are  
21531,the movie is the equivalent of french hiphop  which also seems to play on a 10year delay  
21532,truly wonderful tale 
21533,some cute moments 
21534,pack raw dough in my ears 
21535,an unusual but pleasantly haunting debut behind the camera 
21536,heard a mysterious voice  and felt myself powerfully drawn toward the light  the light of the exit sign 
21537,it looks good  sonny  but you missed the point   
21538,just goes on and on and on and on 
21539,the playful paranoia of the film s past 
21540,shot two years ago 
21541,saddled with an unwieldy cast of characters and angles  but the payoff is powerful and revelatory  
21542,shines through every frame 
21543,there s much to recommend the film  
21544,a minor film with major pleasures from portuguese master manoel de oliviera 
21545,in rhetoric and cliché 
21546,changing lanes is an anomaly for a hollywood movie  it s a wellwritten and occasionally challenging social drama that actually has something interesting to say  
21547,celebrates the group s playful spark of nonconformity  glancing vividly back at what hibiscus grandly called his  angels of light  
21548,a cinematic fluidity and sense of intelligence 
21549,there was ever a movie where the upbeat ending feels like a copout 
21550,takes such a speedy swan dive 
21551,you watch them clumsily mugging their way through snow dogs 
21552,said the film was better than saving private ryan  
21553,most pleasurable expressions of pure movie love to come from an american director in years  
21554,perfectly describes pauline  paulette 
21555,make the attraction a movie 
21556,an inexpressible and drab wannabe looking for that exact niche 
21557,there s a lot of tooth in roger dodger  
21558,can report that it is instead a cheap cliché 
21559,settles into a most traditional  reserved kind of filmmaking 
21560,tootsie 
21561,absorbing characters 
21562,putrid it is not worth the price of the match that should be used to burn every print of the film 
21563,change the fact that what we have here is a load of clams left in the broiling sun for a good three days 
21564,ends up falling short as a whole 
21565,like the excruciating end of days  collateral damage presents schwarzenegger as a tragic figure  but sympathy really belongs with any viewer forced to watch him try out so many complicated facial expressions  
21566,would have a good time here  
21567,doze off for a few minutes or 
21568,to life in the performances 
21569,unlikable characters 
21570,is often preachy and poorly acted 
21571,red dragon  is entertaining  
21572,a semiautobiographical film that s so sloppily written and cast that you can not believe anyone more central to the creation of bugsy than the caterer 
21573,terrific performance 
21574,shows excess in business and pleasure 
21575,that hong kong action cinema is still alive and kicking 
21576,this summer that do not involve a dentist drill 
21577,is a disaster  with cloying messages and irksome characters  
21578,tank 
21579,the movie knew what to do with him 
21580,you do nt need to be a hiphop fan to appreciate scratch  and that s the mark of a documentary that works 
21581,like nothing we westerners have seen before 
21582, ramsay  visually transforms the dreary expanse of deadend distaste the characters inhabit into a poem of art  music and metaphor  
21583,even if it pushes its agenda too forcefully  this remains a film about something  one that attempts and often achieves a level of connection and concern  
21584,a charming  funny and beautifully crafted import 
21585,romantic  riveting and handsomely 
21586,sensual delights and simmering violence 
21587,it desperately wants to be a wacky  screwball comedy  but 
21588,we get a stab at soccer hooliganism  a doublebarreled ripoff of quentin tarantino s climactic shootout  and meat loaf explodes  
21589,charm and charisma 
21590,see an artist  still committed to growth in his ninth decade 
21591,laggard drama wending its way to an uninspired philosophical epiphany  
21592,a film with a great premise but only a great premise  
21593,like  
21594,check your brain 
21595,tells this very compelling tale 
21596,guilt in an intriguing bit of storytelling 
21597,is a gorgeous and deceptively minimalist cinematic tone poem

21599,this elegant entertainment 
21600,a visual style unique and inherent

21609,proves that director m night shyamalan can weave an eerie spell and that mel gibson can gasp  shudder and even tremble without losing his machismo 
21610,will enjoy seeing how both evolve 
21611,listen to extremist namecalling  
21612,of the lovableloser protagonist 
21613,his character s abundant humanism makes him the film s moral compass 
21614,real raw emotion 
21615,the acting is amateurish  the cinematography is atrocious  the direction is clumsy  the writing is insipid and 
21616,the film maintains a beguiling serenity and poise that make it accessible for a nonnarrative feature  
21617,s a great american adventure and a wonderful film to bring to imax

21628,this unique and entertaining twist on the classic whale s tale 
21629,of failed jokes  twitchy acting  and general boorishness 
21630,is not only a love song to the movies 
21631,its dying 
21632,affected child acting

21750,there are nt too many films that can be as simultaneously funny  offbeat and heartwarming  without a thick shmear of the goo  at least   but  elling  manages to do all three quite well  making it one of the year s most enjoyable releases  
21751,it s better to go in knowing full well what s going to happen  but willing to let the earnestness of its execution and skill of its cast take you down a familiar road with a few twists

21753,little style 
21754,a bit of heart and unsettling subject matter

21821,sloppily 
21822,gawky 
21823,it s possible that something hip and transgressive was being attempted here that stubbornly refused to gel  but

21874,his most critically insightful 
21875,is as appalling as any  comedy  to ever spill from a projector s lens 
21876,the speculative effort is hampered by taylor s cartoonish performance and the film s illconsidered notion that hitler s destiny was shaped by the most random of chances

22420,a creepy and deadon performance 
22421,unfortunately  a cast of competent performers from movies  television and the theater are cast adrift in various new york city locations with no unifying rhythm or visual style  
22422,you missed the point 
22423,has a lot going for it  not least the brilliant performances by testud  and parmentier  
22424,give you a lot of laughs in this simple  sweet and romantic comedy 
22425,has the potential for touched by an angel simplicity and sappiness 
22426,deceptions 
22427,proves once again that a man in drag is not in and of himself funny 
22428,but a little too smugly 
22429,most flamboyant female comics 
22430,the filmmakers want nothing else than to show us a good time  and 
22431,the hardtopredict and absolutely essential chemistry 
22432,a fascinating glimpse into an insular world that gives the lie to many clichés and showcases a group of dedicated artists 
22433,believe that resident evil is not it 
22434,wellcrafted family film 
22435,thrill 
22436,awesome 
22437,piercing domestic drama 
22438,go back and choose to skip it 
22439,runofthemill profanity 
22440,bittersweet 
22441,mediocre movie 
22442,all over the map thematically and stylistically  and borrows heavily from lynch  jeunet  and von trier while failing to find a spark of its own 
22443,the movie is about as deep as that sentiment  
22444,solid and refined piece 
22445,it s not too fast and not too slow  
22446,with an unflappable air of decadent urbanity  everett remains a perfect wildean actor  and a relaxed firth displays impeccable comic skill  
22447,93 minutes of unrecoverable life 
22448,s selfdefeatingly decorous 
22449,but the feelings evoked in the film are lukewarm and quick to pass  
22450,a sour taste in one s mouth  
22451,highprofile name 
22452,of clams left in the broiling sun for a good three days 
22453,the little chinese seamstress that transforms this story about love and culture into a cinematic poem 
22454,this datenight diversion will definitely win some hearts 
22455,it is also beautifully acted  
22456,sprightly spin 
22457,maintains your sympathy for this otherwise challenging soul 
22458,college 
22459,from its nauseating spinning credits sequence to a very talented but underutilized supporting cast  bartleby squanders as much as it gives out  
22460,of the most genuinely sweet films 
22461,the whole affair  true story or not  feels incredibly hokey   it  comes off like a hallmark commercial 
22462,obnoxious 88minute 
22463,is a happy  heady jumble of thought and storytelling  an insane comic undertaking that ultimately coheres into a sane and breathtakingly creative film 
22464,the fat 
22465,is disappointing 
22466,footage that might have made no such thing a trenchant  ironic cultural satire instead of a frustrating misfire 
22467,plainly dull and visually ugly 
22468,another  most of which involve precocious kids getting the better of obnoxious adults 
22469, this flick is fun  and host to some truly excellent sequences  
22470,the movie sinks into an abyss of clichés  depression and bad alternative music  
22471,it s a spectacular performance  ahem 
22472,presents a frightening and compelling  what if 
22473,even predictable remake 
22474,puts a suspenseful spin on standard horror flick formula 
22475,we value in our daily lives 
22476,as an actor s showcase  hart s war has much to recommend it  even if the topbilled willis is not the most impressive player  
22477,is distressingly rote 
22478,captures the raw comic energy of one of our most flamboyant female comics 
22479,none of this is meaningful or memorable  but 
22480,all that memorable  but as downtown saturday matinee brain 
22481,with humor 
22482,a sobering and powerful documentary 
22483,casts its spooky net out into the atlantic ocean and spits it back  
22484, amusing study 
22485,technical triumph 
22486,gluing you to the edge of your seat 
22487,fails to convince the audience that these brats will ever be anything more than losers 
22488,you begin to long for the end credits as the desert does for rain  
22489,who deserve but rarely receive it 
22490,most aggressive and most sincere 
22491,be used to burn every print of the film 
22492,takes too long to shake 
22493,like a prison stretch 
22494,it s selfdefeatingly decorous

22496,its own direction 
22497,exciting documentary 
22498,their own cleverness 
22499,if you re over 25  have an iq over 90  and have a driver s license 
22500,is an elegantly balanced movie  every member of the ensemble has something fascinating to do  that does nt reveal even a hint of artifice 
22501,a college story that works even without vulgarity  sex scenes  and cussing  
22502,neatly and effectively captures the debilitating grief 
22503,for proof of that on the cinematic front  look no further than this 20th anniversary edition of the film that spielberg calls  retrospectively  his most personal work yet  
22504,it s not really funny 
22505,savagely 
22506,that storytelling has value can not be denied  
22507,is truly funny  playing a kind of ghandi gone bad  
22508,indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest 
22509,concentration 
22510,tendency to slip into hokum 
22511,is enriched by an imaginatively mixed cast of antic spirits  headed by christopher plummer as the subtlest and most complexly evil uncle ralph i ve ever seen in the many film and stage adaptations of the work  
22512,admirable energy  fullbodied characterizations and 
22513,funny  and even touching

22518,in the arguments of competing lawyers 
22519,of that moral favorite 
22520,by folks worthy of scorn 
22521,achieves near virtuosity in its crapulence 
22522,confessions may not be a straightforward bio  nor does it offer much in the way of barris  motivations  but the film is an oddly fascinating depiction of an architect of pop culture  
22523,a failure of storytelling 
22524,jackass is a vulgar and 
22525,drama that takes itself all too seriously 
22526,is extraordinary 
22527, but why bother if you re going to subjugate truth to the tearjerking demands of soap opera 
22528,some like it hot on the hardwood proves once again that a man in drag is not in and of himself funny  
22529,dislikable 
22530,voyeuristic spectacle 
22531,as predictable as the outcome of a globetrottersgenerals game  juwanna mann is even more ludicrous than you d expect from the guyinadress genre  
22532,updates the setting in an attempt to make the film relevant today  without fully understanding what it was that made the story relevant in the first place 
22533,on digital video  whose tiny camera enables shafer to navigate spaces both large  and small  with considerable aplomb 
22534,nothing funny in this everyjokehas  beentolda

22556,articulates the tangled feelings of particular new yorkers deeply touched by an unprecedented tragedy  
22557,understands characters must come first 
22558,it has the air of a surprisingly juvenile lark  a popinfluenced prank whose charms are immediately apparent and wear thin with repetition  
22559,is its reliance on formula

22561,marvelous documentary touches

22580,a fine effort 
22581,the triumph of his band 
22582,mediocre end 
22583,is amateurish 
22584,the strength of the film comes not from any cinematic razzledazzle but from its recovery of an historical episode that  in the simple telling  proves simultaneously harrowing and uplifting  
22585,re convinced that this mean machine was a decent tv outing that just does nt have big screen magic 
22586,s too close to real life to make sense 
22587,feels capable of charming the masses with star power  a popinduced score and sentimental moments that have become a spielberg trademark  
22588,illustrates why the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts in today s hollywood

22590,tainted 
22591,tired stereotypes 
22592,seagal ran out of movies years ago  and this is just the proof  
22593,tragic waste 
22594,after an hour and a half of wondering  sometimes amusedly  sometimes impatiently  just what this strenuously unconventional movie is supposed to be  you discover that the answer is as conventional as can be  
22595,a deft pace master and stylist 
22596,godard uses his characters  if that s not too glorified a term  as art things  mouthpieces  visual motifs  blanks  
22597,they do nt fit well together

22619,as the chatter of parrots raised on oprah 
22620,visual clarity and deeply 
22621,a loud  lowbudget and tired formula film 
22622,video  and so devoid of artifice and purpose that it appears not to have been edited at all 
22623,looks more like a travelagency video targeted at people who like to ride bikes topless and roll in the mud than a worthwhile glimpse of independentcommunity guiding lights  
22624,honest  sensitive story 
22625, t  he ideas of revolution  9 are more compelling than the execution 
22626,he s just a sad aristocrat in tattered finery  and the film seems as deflated as he does  
22627,a halfway intriguing plot 
22628,klein  charming in comedies like american pie and deadon in election  delivers one of the saddest action hero performances ever witnessed  
22629,2002 s first great film 
22630,its paint fights  motorized scooter chases 
22631,do nt judge this one too soon  it s a dark  gritty story but it takes off in totally unexpected directions and keeps on going  
22632,little action  almost

22634,to believe in it the most 
22635,the full monty  but a really strong second effort

22639,requiring a great deal of thought 
22640,enduring strengths 
22641,offers a desperately ingratiating performance 
22642,tired  unimaginative and derivative 
22643,is a more fascinating look at the future than  bladerunner  and one of the most highconcept sci fi adventures attempted for the screen  
22644,stale

22650,there are laughs aplenty  
22651,funny and wellcontructed black comedy 
22652,grace to call for prevention rather than to place blame  making it one of the best war movies ever made 
22653,will be well worth your time 
22654,seems far more interested in grossout humor than in showing us wellthought stunts or a car chase that we have nt seen 10000 times  
22655,same old story 
22656,is solid  satisfying fare for adults 
22657,shallow styles

22659,set up 
22660,as an actress  madonna is one helluva singer  
22661,ends up sounding like satire 
22662, the film manages to keep you at the edge of your seat with its shapeshifting perils  political intrigue and brushes with calamity  
22663, soderbergh  tends to place most of the psychological and philosophical material in italics rather than trust an audience s intelligence  and 
22664,seen  constantly pulling the rug from underneath us  seeing things from new sides  plunging deeper  getting more intense 
22665,begins to seem as long as the two year affair which is its subject 
22666,are great rewards here 
22667,terribly episodic and lacking the spark of imagination that might have made it an exhilarating 
22668,the touch is generally light enough and the performances  for the most part  credible 
22669,slapstick sequences 
22670,suitably elegant 
22671,the most moronic screenplays 
22672,i become very involved in the proceedings  to me 
22673,a splash 
22674,is a far bigger  far more meaningful story than one in which little green men come to earth for harvesting purposes 
22675,comes far closer than many movies to expressing the way many of us live  someplace between consuming selfabsorption and insistently demanding otherness  
22676,the film has the throwntogether feel of a summercamp talent show  hastily written  underrehearsed  arbitrarily plotted and filled with crude humor and vulgar innuendo  
22677,sitting in a downtown café  overhearing a bunch of typical latetwentysomethings natter on about nothing  
22678, at times sublime  visuals

22690,thoughtlessly assembled 
22691,edward burns  sidewalks of new york look like oscar wilde 
22692,though jay roach directed the film from the back of a taxicab 
22693, carvey s  characters are both overplayed and exaggerated 
22694,it s certainly an honest attempt to get at something 
22695,cheap cliché 
22696,slopped  
22697,faint of heart or conservative of spirit 
22698,the upbeat ending 
22699,makes each crumb of emotional comfort 
22700,a popinfluenced prank whose charms are immediately apparent 
22701,of the lightweight female empowerment 
22702,that s as crisp and to the point 
22703,snoots will no doubt rally to its cause  trotting out threadbare standbys like  masterpiece  and  triumph  and all that malarkey  but rarely does an established filmmaker so ardently waste viewers  time with a gobbler like this

22714,to suffer  
22715,made tucker a star 
22716,s a real shame that so much of the movie  again  as in the animal  is a slapdash mess 
22717,adroit but finally a trifle flat  mad love does nt galvanize its outrage the way  say 
22718,children  a heartfelt romance for teenagers and 
22719,is workmanlike in the extreme 
22720,an example of quiet  confident craftsmanship that tells a sweet  charming tale of intergalactic friendship 
22721,of his sweetness and vulnerability 
22722,putting the primitive murderer inside a hightech space station unleashes a pandora s box of special effects that run the gamut from cheesy to cheesier to cheesiest 
22723,humanly possible 
22724,is a fascinating film because there is no clearcut hero and no allout villain  
22725,the offcenter humor 
22726,overtly silly dialogue

22728,happens when something goes bump in the night and nobody cares 
22729,amiable but 
22730,terribly funny 
22731,a film neither bitter nor sweet  neither romantic nor comedic  neither warm nor fuzzy 
22732,just another combination of bad animation and mindless violence 
22733,a colorful  joyous celebration of life  a tapestry woven of romance  dancing  singing  and unforgettable characters 
22734,bad writing  
22735,maintain both a level of sophisticated intrigue and humanscale characters that suck the audience in 
22736,an invaluable historical document thanks to the filmmaker s extraordinary access to massoud  whose charm  cultivation and devotion to his people are readily apparent 
22737,with humorous observations about the general absurdity of modern life 
22738,to make their way through this tragedy 
22739,directs  ideally 
22740,a movie like the guys is why film criticism can be considered work  
22741,just as the recent argentine film son of the bride reminded us that a feelgood movie can still show real heart  time of favor presents us with an action movie that actually has a brain  
22742,leave them singing long after the credits roll

22760,camaraderie

22789,green dragon is still a deeply moving effort to put a human face on the travail of thousands of vietnamese

22870,for all the charm of kevin kline and a story that puts oldfashioned values under the microscope  there s something creepy about this movie

22898, you re a jet all the way 
22899,worse stunt editing or cheaper action movie production

22917,too heavy for the plot 
22918,for reverence and a little wit 
22919,too campy to work as straight drama and too violent and sordid to function as comedy  vulgar is  truly and thankfully  a oneofakind work  
22920,fun  
22921,an uneasy mix

22929,the film is not only a love song to the movies 
22930,just a string of stale gags 
22931,this film can only point the way  but thank goodness for this signpost  
22932,is little else 
22933,because  the leads  are such a companionable couple 
22934,lacks the utter authority of a genre gem 
22935, this loose collection of largely improvised numbers would probably have worked better as a onehour tv documentary

23002,florid but ultimately vapid crime melodrama 
23003,a cheap scam put together by some cynical creeps at revolution studios and imagine entertainment to make the suckers out there surrender  9 and 93 minutes of unrecoverable life  
23004,the story is predictable  the jokes are typical sandler fare  and the romance with ryder is puzzling 
23005,charismatic 
23006,clumsiness 
23007,an amazing breakthrough 
23008,due to stodgy  soap operaish dialogue  the rest of the cast comes across as stick figures reading lines from a teleprompter

23220,the movie is all portent and no content 
23221,creates a fluid and mesmerizing sequence of images 
23222,ensues when brash young men set out to conquer the online world with laptops  cell phones and sketchy business plans 
23223,incurably romantic 
23224,vibrance 
23225,take for granted in most films are mishandled here  
23226,remarkable yet 
23227,i have given this movie a rating of zero  
23228,wellthought stunts 
23229,but certainly hard to hate 
23230,a wry  affectionate delight 
23231,scores a direct hit  
23232,is nt downright silly 
23233,every moment crackles with tension  and 
23234,wildlife

23236,a bit exploitative 
23237,welled up in my eyes both times 
23238,inspires more 
23239,fill the hot chick  the latest gimmick from this unimaginative comedian 
23240,the leads  are such a companionable couple 
23241,gutter romancer s 
23242,this is a more fascinating look at the future than  bladerunner  and one of the most highconcept sci fi adventures attempted for the screen  
23243,of wladyslaw szpilman  who is not only a pianist  but a good human being 
23244,shrewd 
23245,a journey spanning nearly three decades of bittersweet camaraderie and history  in which we feel that we truly know what makes holly and marina tick  and our hearts go out to them as both continue to negotiate their imperfect  lovehate relationship 
23246,heartfelt 
23247,make a splash even greater than arnold schwarzenegger  jeanclaud van damme or steven segal 
23248,peculiar and always entertaining costume drama 
23249,shamelessly enjoyed it 
23250,the most part a useless movie 
23251,crap on a leash  far too polite to scale the lunatic heights of joe dante s similarly styled gremlins 
23252,thumbs down due to the endlessly repetitive scenes of embarrassment 
23253,the best film of the year 2002 
23254,ca nt disguise that he s spiffing up leftovers that are nt so substantial or fresh 
23255,the material and the production itself are little more than routine  
23256,to be taken seriously 
23257,this is a heartfelt story  it just is nt a very involving one 
23258,a thoughtful and surprisingly affecting portrait of a screwedup man who dared to mess with some powerful people  seen through the eyes of the idealistic kid who chooses to champion his ultimately losing cause  
23259,an ingenious and often harrowing 
23260,shabby digital photography 
23261,a pretty good execution 
23262,rerun 
23263, wendigo is a genuinely bonechilling tale  
23264,of the most affecting depictions of a love affair 
23265,is an inexpressible and drab wannabe looking for that exact niche 
23266,a technical triumph and 
23267,the middle of the road  where the thematic ironies are too obvious and the sexual politics too smug 
23268,unpleasant 
23269,s an excellent 90minute film here 
23270,ambitious 
23271,fun and nimble 
23272,allowing us to find the small  human moments  and leaving off with a grand whimper 
23273,purposefully 
23274,the filmmakers try to balance pointed  often incisive satire and unabashed sweetness  with results that are sometimes bracing  sometimes baffling and quite often  and in unexpected ways  touching  
23275,cheesier to cheesiest 
23276,muddled 
23277,tongue to keep from laughing at the ridiculous dialog or the ohso convenient plot twists

23280,will be two hours gained 
23281,bore most audiences 
23282,a clumsily manufactured exploitation flick 
23283,a crisp psychological drama  and  a fascinating little thriller that would have been perfect for an old  twilight zone  episode 
23284,feels from being dragged through a sad  sordid universe of guns  drugs  avarice and damaged dreams 
23285,a few good laughs 
23286,is more fully 
23287,the film has the highbuffed gloss and highoctane jolts you expect of de palma  but what makes it transporting is that it s also one of the smartest  most pleasurable expressions of pure movie love to come from an american director in years  
23288,takes its central idea way too seriously 
23289,annoying and 
23290,you ll want to crawl up your own  in embarrassment 
23291,would require many sessions on the couch of dr freud  
23292,sweettempered 
23293,that underlies the best of comedies 
23294,fairly harmless 
23295,no big whoop 
23296,arrives at its heart  as simple selfreflection meditation 
23297,an oldfashioned scary movie  one that relies on lingering terror punctuated by sudden shocks and not constant bloodshed 
23298,solid performances and 
23299,occasional jarring glimpses of a modern theater audience watching the events unfold 
23300,to the movie s contrived  lame screenplay and listless direction

23302,dopey old 
23303,craven

23307,most immediate and most obvious 
23308,gaunt 
23309,be a bit of a cheat in the end 
23310,aimed mainly at little kids but with plenty of entertainment value to keep grownups from squirming in their seats 
23311,something else altogether  clownish and offensive and nothing at all like real life 
23312,with enough unexpected twists 
23313,that rival vintage looney tunes for the most creative mayhem in a brief amount of time 
23314,a movie that understands characters must come first 
23315,being the ultraviolent gangster wannabe 
23316,weighty revelations  flowery dialogue  and nostalgia for the past 
23317,how good 
23318,philosophical emptiness and maddeningly sedate pacing 
23319,also demonstrate how desperate the makers of this  we re  doingitfor  thecash  sequel were

23321,of fighting hard for something that really matters 
23322,amiable

23331,feels like a streetwise mclaughlin group  and never fails to entertain 
23332,over a lateinning twist that just does nt make sense 
23333,assayas  ambitious  sometimes beautiful adaptation of jacques chardonne 
23334,through this picture i was beginning to hate it 
23335,so many red herrings  
23336,be low  very low  very very low  for the masquerade to work 
23337,technical flaws to get in the way 
23338,the triviality 
23339,articulates 
23340,kapur gives us episodic choppiness  undermining the story s emotional thrust  
23341,the superficially written characters ramble on tediously about their lives  loves and the art 
23342,substantive movie 
23343,is throwing up his hands in surrender  is firing his rd people  and has decided he will just screen the master of disguise 247  
23344,is so pat it makes your teeth hurt 
23345,sensual 
23346,that pollyana would reach for a barf bag  
23347,the film is an earnest try at beachcombing verismo  but it would be even more indistinct than it is were it not for the striking  quietly vulnerable personality of ms ambrose 
23348,wildly inventive mixture 
23349,delightfully unpredictable  hilarious comedy 
23350,an uplifting  nearmasterpiece

23354,for perfectly acceptable  occasionally very enjoyable children s entertainment 
23355,completely delightful 
23356,the teenybopper set 
23357,wish had been developed with more care 
23358,of those movies that catches you up in something bigger than yourself 
23359,of animal house 
23360,payne constructs a hilarious ode to middle america and middle age with this unlikely odyssey  featuring a pathetic  endearing hero who is all too human  
23361,of american pie hijinks 
23362,a terrific screenplay and 
23363,the film s creepy 
23364,an offbeat and fanciful film about the human need for monsters to blame for all that 
23365,s better than the phantom menace 
23366, instead go rent  shakes the clown   a much funnier film with a similar theme and an equally great robin williams performance  
23367,an angel simplicity 
23368,an odd  haphazard  and inconsequential romantic comedy  
23369,look as if it were being shown on the projection television screen of a sports bar 
23370,takes hold and grips 
23371,sad but endearing characters 
23372,outrageous or funny 
23373,it seeks to rely on an ambiguous presentation

23377,flakeball 
23378, introspective and entertaining 
23379,the best of godard s movies 
23380,no amount of good acting 
23381,nobody here bothered to check it twice  
23382, cremaster 3  should come with the warning  for serious film buffs only   
23383,more strongly 
23384,the believer is nothing less than a provocative piece of work 
23385,though he only scratches the surface  at least he provides a strong itch to explore more  
23386,horrible pains 
23387,been there  done that  
23388,laughable 
23389,seems a bit on the skinny side 
23390,the story  is inspiring  ironic  and revelatory of just how ridiculous and moneyoriented the record industry really is  
23391,neatly 
23392,same love story 
23393,i stopped thinking about how good it all was  and started doing nothing but reacting to it  feeling a part of its grand locations  thinking urgently as the protagonists struggled  feeling at the mercy of its inventiveness  gasping at its visual delights  
23394,the cast  collectively a successful example of the lovableloser protagonist  shows deft comic timing  
23395,quaid is utterly fearless as the tortured husband living a painful lie  and 
23396,i have nt seen such selfamused trash since freddy got fingered  
23397,works  
23398,s coherent  well shot  
23399,guess a space station in the year 2455 can be crossed off the list of ideas for the inevitable future sequels  hey  do nt shoot the messenger   
23400,s already a joke in the united states  
23401,a heartbreakingly thoughtful minor classic 
23402, lots of boring talking heads  etc  
23403,like the original 
23404,of the yaya sisterhood 
23405,give shapiro  goldman  and bolado credit for good intentions  but there s nothing here that they could nt have done in half an hour 
23406,unimaginative 
23407,a dramatic comedy as pleasantly 
23408,to a superior crime movie 
23409,in an increasingly important film industry and 
23410,s dull  spiritless  silly and monotonous 
23411,the likes 
23412,without resorting to camp or parody 
23413,terrific special effects and 
23414,improved upon the first and 
23415,has about 34th the fun of its spry 2001 predecessor  but it s a rushed  slapdash  sequelforthesake  ofasequel with less than half the plot and ingenuity 
23416,an overlyfamiliar set 
23417,this waferthin movie 
23418,this film speaks for itself 
23419,about a domestic unit finding their way to joy 
23420,sublime music 
23421,should never have been brought out of hibernation 
23422,it never rises to its clever whatif concept  
23423,it s a lot to ask people to sit still for two hours and change watching such a character  especially when rendered in as flat and impassive a manner as phoenix s  
23424,a genuine love story  
23425,will indie filmmakers subject us to boring  selfimportant stories of how horrible we are to ourselves and each other 
23426,avarice and damaged dreams 
23427,devoid of objectivity and full of nostalgic comments from the now middleaged participants 
23428,the comedy equivalent of saddam hussein 
23429,dark  gritty  sometimes funny little gem 
23430,an overripe episode of tv s dawson s creek and a recycled and dumbeddown version of love story 
23431,it s still damn funny stuff 
23432,distanced us 
23433,a sleepinducingly slowpaced crime drama with clumsy dialogue  heavyhanded phoneyfeeling sentiment  and an overlyfamiliar set of plot devices  
23434,the performances are amiable and committed  and the comedy more often than not hits the bullseye 
23435,er  bubbly 
23436,of candid camera 
23437, opening up  the play more has partly closed it down  
23438,mr spielberg s 1993 classic 
23439,was a guilty pleasure 
23440,this sneaky feel to it  as if the director is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as very important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a hollywood product 
23441,throws quirky characters  odd situations  and offkilter dialogue at us 
23442,you come away from his film overwhelmed  hopeful and  perhaps paradoxically  illuminated  
23443, but director carl franklin adds enough flourishes and freakouts to make it entertaining  
23444,stand as intellectual masterpieces 
23445,a superlative b movie  funny  sexy  and rousing 
23446,relic from a bygone era  and its convolutions  
23447,its screwedup characters 
23448, thoughtfully written 
23449,though the story  is hackneyed 
23450,seem all that profound  at least by way of what can be gleaned from this threehour endurance test built around an hour s worth of actual material 
23451, headbanger  
23452,fun and 
23453,lively songs for deft punctuation 
23454,are about a half dozen young turks angling to see how many times they can work the words  radical  or  suck  into a sentence 
23455,wellputtogether piece 
23456,boring talking heads  
23457,  rollerball  2002 may go down in cinema history as the only movie ever in which the rest of the cast was outshined by ll cool j 
23458,this is nt a stand up and cheer flick  it s a sit down and ponder affair  
23459,provides an invaluable service 
23460,hackneyed elements 
23461,help sustain it 
23462,plays like a livingroom war of the worlds  gaining most of its unsettling force from the suggested and the unknown  
23463,onscreen chemistry 
23464,by director jon purdy s sledgehammer sap 
23465,created a brilliant motion picture 
23466, miller eloquently captures the moment when a woman s life  out of a deepseated  emotional need  is about to turn onto a different path  
23467,with serious ideas 
23468,i suppose it s lovely that cal works out his issues with his dad and comes to terms with his pictureperfect life  but world traveler gave me no reason to care 
23469,means a great movie  but it is a refreshingly forthright one  
23470,seems embarrassed by his own invention 
23471,a prison comedy that never really busts out of its comfy little cell  
23472,this familiar riseandfall tale is long on glamour and short on larger moralistic consequences  though it s told with sharp ears and eyes for the tenor of the times  
23473,inspiring or insightful 
23474,did nt hollywood think of this sooner 
23475,a lot more bluster than bite 
23476,attempts  in vain 
23477,guess it just goes to show that if you give a filmmaker an unlimited amount of phony blood  nothing good can happen 
23478,give you a few laughs 
23479,uninteresting  unlikeable people 
23480,with real thematic heft 
23481,proves it s never too late to learn  
23482,did nt have an original bone in his body 
23483,a look for its truetolife characters  its sensitive acting  its unadorned view of rural life and the subtle direction of firsttimer hilary birmingham 
23484,welcome relief 
23485,contrived  unmotivated  and 
23486,if encouraging return 
23487,tv episodes 
23488,with an expressive face reminiscent of gong li and a vivid personality like zhang ziyi s 
23489,uncommonly sincere movie that portrays the frank humanity of  emotional recovery 
23490,laconic and very stilted in its dialogue  this indie flick never found its audience  probably because it s extremely hard to relate to any of the characters  
23491,mistyeyed southern nostalgia piece 
23492,a momentum that never lets up 
23493,with cute accents performing agesold slapstick and unfunny tricks 
23494,inescapably gorgeous  
23495,lagging 
23496,it is most of the things costner movies are known for  it s sanctimonious  selfrighteous and so eager to earn our love that you want to slap it 
23497,an original talent 
23498,much firstrate 
23499,a sour taste in your mouth 
23500,some of the characters die and others do nt  and the film pretends that those living have learned some sort of lesson  and  really  
23501,a sham 
23502,needed 
23503,mean it still wo nt feel like the longest 90 minutes of your moviegoing life 
23504,this bitter italian comedy 
23505,to be passionate and truthful 
23506,the art direction and costumes are gorgeous and finely detailed 
23507,it is a kind  unapologetic  sweetheart of a movie 
23508,how thoroughly unrewarding all of this 
23509,cinema s directorial giants 
23510, i spy is still fun and enjoyable and so aggressively silly that it s more than a worthwhile effort  
23511,baran is a gentle film with dramatic punch  a haunting ode to humanity  
23512,who cares    
23513,is that it s not as obnoxious as tom green s freddie got fingered 
23514,a determined  ennuihobbled slog 
23515,photographed and staged by mendes with a series of riveting set pieces the likes of which mainstream audiences have rarely seen 
23516,with a sense of his reserved but existential poignancy 
23517,is pretty landbound  with its leaden acting  dull exposition and telegraphed  surprises  
23518,the grey zone attempts to be grandiloquent  but ends up merely pretentious  in a grisly sort of way  
23519,take  its  earnest errors and hardwon rewards over the bombastic selfglorification of other feelgood fiascos like antwone fisher or the emperor s club any time 
23520,while hollywood ending has its share of belly laughs  including a knockout of a closing line

23527,a big letdown 
23528,snooze  
23529,often heartbreaking 
23530,can be as tiresome as 9 seconds of jesse helms  anti castro

23542,falls short in building the drama of lilia s journey

23633,extra little something 
23634,i can channel one of my greatest pictures  drunken master 
23635,lousy script 
23636,is filled with humorous observations about the general absurdity of modern life as seen through the eyes outsiders

23644,loved the look of this film 
23645,the tuxedo was nt just bad  
23646,of unfocused  excruciatingly tedious cinema 
23647,the overcooked  hamfisted direction  
23648,mesmerizing music 
23649,may be more genial than ingenious  but 
23650,while it is interesting to witness the conflict from the palestinian side  longley s film lacks balance  and fails to put the struggle into meaningful historical context  
23651,fans of the modern day hong kong action film finally have the worthy successor to a better tomorrow and the killer which they have been patiently waiting for

23664,decomposition 
23665,comes across as lame and sophomoric in this debut indie feature 
23666,based filmmakers anne de marcken and marilyn freeman did just that and it s what makes their project so interesting 
23667,filmmaking from one of french cinema s master craftsmen 
23668,s 86 minutes too long 
23669,gondry s direction is adequate  but what gives human nature its unique feel is kaufman s script  
23670,innocence and idealism

23685,entirely successful 
23686,a surprising winner 
23687,a loud  brash and mainly unfunny high school comedy

23699,undone by a sloppy script 
23700,is genuinely witty 
23701,as tricky and satisfying as any of david 
23702,any recent film  independent or otherwise  
23703,maintains an appealing veneer without becoming too cute about it 
23704,maintains a surprisingly buoyant tone 
23705,that santa bumps up against 21st century reality so hard 
23706,that the gang feels comfortable with taking insane liberties and doing the goofiest stuff out of left field 
23707,throughout all the tumult 
23708,perfectly pleasant if slightly pokey comedy 
23709,to dogpaddle in the mediocre end of the pool 
23710,sentimental but entirely irresistible 
23711,too often into sugary sentiment and withholds delivery on the pellmell pyrotechnics its punchy style promises 
23712,the killing field and the barbarism of  ethnic cleansing 
23713,have dumped a whole lot of plot in favor of  outrageous gags 
23714,to be had from films crammed with movie references

23716,dullingly repetitive 
23717,formuliac 
23718,a complete waste 
23719,does nt hurt anyone and works for its participants 
23720,recommended  as visually bland as a dentist s waiting room

23724,denying 
23725,adds enough flourishes and freakouts to make it entertaining 
23726,pushiness 
23727,is confusing on one level or another  making ararat far more demanding than it needs to be  
23728,overcome the film s manipulative sentimentality and annoying stereotypes 
23729,attraction and interdependence 
23730,s easier to change the sheets 
23731,the right place 
23732,such a buoyant  expressive flow of images 
23733,the war movie compendium 
23734,the colorful masseur wastes its time on mood rather than riding with the inherent absurdity of ganesh s rise up the social ladder

23744, nature  loves the members of the upper class almost as much as they love themselves  
23745,uncompelling 
23746,putrid writing  direction and timing with a smile that says   if i stay positive  maybe i can channel one of my greatest pictures  drunken master 
23747,between dumb fun and just plain dumb 
23748,filmed the opera exactly as the libretto directs  ideally capturing the opera s drama and lyricism

23770,is heartfelt and hilarious in ways you ca nt fake 
23771,have otherwise been bland and 
23772,ve seen a movie instead of an endless trailer 
23773,this marvelous film 
23774,s surely something wrong with a comedy where the only belly laughs come from the selection of outtakes tacked onto the end credits 
23775,ozpetek falls short in showing us antonia s true emotions 
23776,director carl franklin  so crisp and economical in one false move  bogs down in genre cliches here  
23777,lathan and diggs carry the film with their charisma  and both exhibit sharp comic timing that makes the more hackneyed elements of the film easier to digest  
23778,due to its rapidfire delivery and 
23779,this pathetic junk is barely an hour long  
23780,with dramatic punch  a haunting ode to humanity 
23781,delivering a more than satisfactory amount of carnage 
23782,reminds you of why animation is such a perfect medium for children  because of the way it allows the mind to enter and accept another world  
23783,an important film 
23784,the last kiss will probably never achieve the popularity of my big fat greek wedding  but 
23785,could hate it for the same reason

23790,another disjointed 
23791,it s a bad sign when you re rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects  deaths just so the documentary will be over  but 
23792,go down with a ship as leaky as this 
23793,in a vat of failed jokes  twitchy acting  and general boorishness 
23794,dedication 
23795,that perverse element 
23796,is on full  irritating display in  this  meandering and pointless french comingofage import from writerdirector annesophie birot

23798,a journey that is as difficult for the audience to take as it is for the protagonist  yet it s potentially just as rewarding  
23799,down over 140 minutes

23869,very enjoyable  
23870,anyone who has seen the hunger or cat people will find little new here 
23871,watching these two actors play against each other so intensely  but with restraint  is a treat

24037,street gangs and turf wars in 1958 brooklyn  stale cliches  gratuitous violence 
24038,saps stuck in an inarticulate screenplay 
24039,silly fluff 
24040,this is a very ambitious project for a fairly inexperienced filmmaker 
24041,a few pieces of the film buzz and whir  very little of it actually clicks  
24042,viewed and treasured for its extraordinary intelligence and originality 
24043,on a number of themes  not least the notion that the marginal members of society  
24044,seems embarrassed 
24045,fairly weak 
24046,has nothing going for it other than its exploitive array of obligatory cheap 
24047,seven ripoff 
24048,on too many triedandtrue shenanigans that hardly distinguish it from the next teen comedy 
24049,the holes in this film 
24050, french director anne fontaine delivers an inspired portrait of maleridden angst and the emotional blockage that accompanies this human condition 
24051,a surprisingly faithful remake 
24052,refreshing 
24053,that slather clearasil over the blemishes of youth 
24054,should be probing why a guy with his talent ended up in a movie this bad 
24055,s got the brawn  but not the brains 
24056,realize  much to our dismay  that this really did happen 
24057,forced drama in this wildly uneven movie  about 
24058,a solid cast  
24059,its material that is deliberately unsettling 
24060,if the full monty was a freshman fluke  lucky break is  cattaneo  sophomore slump  
24061,s a scorcher 
24062,movie fun 
24063,how important our special talents can be when put in service of of others 
24064,the overuse of special effects 
24065,exhibits the shallow sensationalism characteristic of soap opera  more salacious telenovela than serious drama  
24066,shakespeare 
24067,as  wayne 
24068,are really going to love the piano teacher  
24069,serving sara  has nt much more to serve than silly fluff 
24070,it also wrecks any chance of the movie rising above similar fare 
24071,fascination  
24072, murky and weakly acted 
24073,a wonderful  ghastly film 
24074,passionately 
24075,would make an excellent companion piece to the similarly themed  the french lieutenant s woman  
24076,the best ensemble casts 
24077,superior horror flick 
24078,perhaps the best sports movie i ve ever seen  
24079,a high enough level of invention 
24080,a painfully slow clicheridden film filled with more holes than clyde barrow s car  
24081,wreck 
24082,unsettling subject matter 
24083,have to admit it s semiamusing to watch robert deniro belt out  when you re a jet 
24084,a pandora s box of special effects that run the gamut from cheesy to cheesier to cheesiest 
24085,it s not nearly as fresh or enjoyable as its predecessor  but there are enough high points to keep this from being a complete waste of time  
24086,a single iota worse 
24087,a zany mix of saturday night livestyle parody  70s blaxploitation films and goofball action comedy 
24088,a must for fans of british cinema  if only because so many titans of the industry are along for the ride  
24089,one decent performance from the cast and not one clever line of dialogue 
24090,arduous journey 
24091,is intelligently 
24092,and there s the inimitable diaz  holding it all together

24099,providing some good old fashioned spooks 
24100,rather unfocused 
24101,the film would have been more enjoyable had the balance shifted in favor of waterbound action over the landbased  drama   
24102,strains 
24103,it s rare that a movie can be as intelligent as this one is in every regard except its storyline 
24104,hugely enjoyable in its own right though not really faithful to its source s complexity 
24105,you ve completely lowered your entertainment standards 
24106, the tale  like its central figure  vivi  is just a little bit hard to love  
24107,in good measure 
24108,angela gheorghiu as famous prima donna floria tosca  roberto alagna as her lover mario cavaradossi  and ruggero as the villainous  lecherous police chief scarpia  all sing beautifully and act adequately  
24109,captive by mediocrity

24111,as glum as mr de niro 
24112,crane s decline

24115,sorvino makes the princess seem smug and cartoonish  and 
24116,knows how to tell us about people  
24117,the characters are too simplistic to maintain interest  
24118,raimi and his team could nt have done any better in bringing the story of spiderman to the big screen  
24119,another genre exercise 
24120,that george lucas can only dream of 
24121,aftertaste 
24122,a reworking of die hard and cliffhanger but it s nowhere near as exciting as either  
24123,to be delightfully compatible here 
24124,sure  it s contrived and predictable  but its performances are so well tuned that the film comes off winningly  even though it s never as solid as you want it to be  
24125,i d rather watch a rerun of the powerpuff girls 
24126,how lame 
24127, the film gives no quarter to anyone seeking to pull a cohesive story out of its 2 12  hour running time  
24128,to know your icet s from your coolj s to realize that as far as these shootings are concerned  something is rotten in the state of california

24453,de niro  mcdormand and the other good actors 
24454,little substance 
24455,a backstage mustsee for true fans of comedy  
24456,succumbs to cliches and pat storytelling 
24457,and  terrible 
24458,a wonderfully warm human drama that remains vividly in memory long after viewing 
24459,who bilked unsuspecting moviegoers 
24460,is a decomposition of healthy eccentric inspiration and ambition  wearing a cloak of unsentimental  straightforward text  when it s really an exercise in gross romanticization of the delusional personality type

24474, the film has a gentle  unforced intimacy that never becomes claustrophobic  
24475,with zerodimensional  unlikable characters and hackneyed  threadbare comic setups 
24476,goes on for the 110 minutes of  panic room  
24477,lowtech 
24478,he does nt  however  deliver nearly enough of the show s trademark style and flash  
24479,this one gets off with a good natured warning 
24480,sc2 is an autopilot hollywood concoction lacking in imagination and authentic christmas spirit  yet it s geared toward an audience full of masters of both 
24481,real and 
24482,ve already seen city by the sea under a variety of titles 
24483,m not sure which is worse  the poor acting by the ensemble cast  the flat dialogue by vincent r nebrida or the gutless direction by laurice guillen 
24484,does hold up pretty well 
24485,what s most offensive is nt the waste of a good cast  but 
24486,is worth your time  especially if you have ellen pompeo sitting next to you for the ride  
24487,even more ludicrous 
24488,a movie that deserves recommendation 
24489,unexpected moments of authentically impulsive humor are the hallmark of this bittersweet  uncommonly sincere movie that portrays the frank humanity of  emotional recovery  
24490,tv skitcom material fervently deposited on the big screen  
24491,forgotten the movie 
24492,s not enough intelligence  wit or innovation on the screen to attract and sustain an older crowd

24506,loathsome 
24507,give us real situations and characters 
24508,hoary dialogue  fluxing accents  and  worst of all  
24509,emerges as another key contribution 
24510,yet curiously tepid and choppy recycling in which predictability is the only winner 
24511,a movie with a  children s  song that includes the line  my stepdad s not mean  he s just adjusting  
24512,i know i would have liked it more if it had just gone that one step further 
24513,have the highest production values you ve ever seen

24517,quietly moving moments and an intelligent subtlety 
24518,wellwrought 
24519,  safe conduct   is a long movie at 163 minutes but it fills the time with drama  romance  tragedy  bravery  political intrigue  partisans and sabotage  
24520,in the wrong hands 
24521,but it s just too too much 
24522,director charles stone iii applies more detail to the film s music than to the story line  
24523,more complete than indecent proposal 
24524,those seeking a definitive account of eisenstein s life would do better elsewhere  
24525,swooping down on a string of exotic locales 
24526,would nt matter so much that this arrogant richard pryor wannabe s routine is offensive  puerile and unimaginatively foulmouthed if it was at least funny  
24527,idiotic and ugly  
24528,the metaphors are provocative  but too often  the viewer is left puzzled by the mechanics of the delivery 
24529,of humankind s liberating ability 
24530,ends with outtakes in which most of the characters forget their lines and just utter  uhhh   which is better than most of the writing in the movie  
24531,the dimming

24538,unfolds in a series of achronological vignettes whose cumulative effect is chilling  
24539,runs out of steam 
24540,funny humor 
24541,plays like john le carré with a couple of burntout cylinders  
24542,an earnest study 
24543,it contains almost enough chuckles for a threeminute sketch  and no more  
24544,with the unexplained baboon cameo 
24545,serves up all of that stuff 
24546,smothered 
24547,excellent job 
24548,turns a blind eye to the very history it pretends to teach  
24549,merely very bad

24553,firebreathing 
24554,are just two of the elements that will grab you 
24555,potentially trite and overused concept 
24556,to the outstanding soundtrack 
24557,the director mostly plays it straight  turning leys  fable into a listless climb down the social ladder  
24558,the stunts in the tuxedo seem tired and  what s worse  routine 
24559,know why steven seagal is considered a star  nor why he keeps being cast in action films when none of them are ever any good 
24560,original and insightful 
24561,portrayed with almost supernatural powers 
24562,looks elsewhere  seizing on george s haplessness and lucy s personality tics  
24563,pollyana would reach for a barf bag 
24564,influenced by some of the filmmakers who have directed him  especially the coen brothers and steven soderbergh 
24565,memory  resistance and artistic transcendence 
24566,if the full monty was a freshman fluke 
24567,there is a welcome lack of pretension about the film  which very simply sets out to entertain and ends up delivering in good measure  
24568,surprisingly uninvolving 
24569,low  smoky and inviting sizzle 
24570,adventure movie 
24571,in its lackluster gear of emotional blandness 
24572,hailed as a clever exercise in neohitchcockianism  this clever and very satisfying picture is more accurately chabrolian  
24573,perry s good and 
24574,the movie is a lumbering load of hokum but  
24575,succumbs to gravity and plummets to earth 
24576,a more colorful  more playful tone 
24577,solid movie 
24578,a sense of dramatic urgency 
24579,immature and 
24580, the only way for a reasonably intelligent person to get through the country bears is to ponder how a whole segment of popmusic history has been allowed to get wet  fuzzy and sticky  
24581,engaging  wideeyed actress 
24582,offers an unexpected window into the complexities of the middle east struggle and into the humanity of its people  
24583,to one of demme s good films 
24584,end it all by stuffing himself into an electric pencil sharpener 
24585,some worthwhile themes 
24586,made swimfan anyway 
24587,it s horribly depressing and not very well done  
24588,mostly believable  refreshingly lowkey and quietly inspirational little sports 
24589,is generally light enough 
24590,a predictable  manipulative stinker  
24591,perfectly portrays the desperation of a very insecure man 
24592,that returns the martial arts master to top form 
24593,is unable to project either esther s initial anomie or her eventual awakening 
24594,almost every possible way  from the writing and direction to the soggy performances  tossed off 
24595,about the benjamins that s hard to resist 
24596,on the evidence before us  the answer is clear  not easily and  in the end  not well enough  
24597,sweet home abomination 
24598,commands 
24599,which will please eastwood s loyal fans  and suits the story  wherein our hero must ride roughshod over incompetent cops to get his man 
24600,the expressive power of the camera 
24601,the movie s sophomoric blend 
24602,this is an extraordinary film  not least because it is japanese and yet feels universal  
24603,a young robert deniro 
24604,will remind them that hong kong action cinema is still alive and kicking 
24605,earsplitting exercise in formula crashandbash action  
24606,gently humorous 
24607,a wonderful ensemble cast of characters that bring the routine day to day struggles of the working class to life 
24608,waters it down  turning grit and vulnerability into light reading 
24609,say nothing of boring 
24610,might not give a second look if we passed them on the street 
24611,change watching such a character 
24612,memorable

24614,way too full 
24615,like this movie a lot 
24616,a bumper 
24617,coral reef adventure is a heavyweight film that fights a good fight on behalf of the world s endangered reefs  and it lets the pictures do the punching  
24618,sultry 
24619,all too literally 
24620,less a movie than 
24621,it s the very definition of epic adventure  
24622,a  soulless 
24623,an adventure story and history lesson all in one 
24624,a pale xerox of other  better crime movies  
24625, and at times  all my loved ones more than flirts with kitsch  the tale commands attention  
24626,poignancy jostling against farce  thoughtful dialogue elbowed aside by oneliners  and a visual style that incorporates rotoscope animation for no apparent reason except  maybe  that it looks neat 
24627,made me want to pack raw dough in my ears 
24628,in between all the emotional seesawing  it s hard to figure the depth of these two literary figures  and even the times in which they lived  
24629,is worth your time  
24630,symbiotic relationship 
24631, are about a half dozen young turks angling to see how many times they can work the words  radical  or  suck  into a sentence  
24632,it really won my heart 
24633,of brooding personalities that parade about as if they were coming back from stock character camp  a drowsy drama infatuated by its own pretentious selfexamination 
24634,an intriguing look at the french film industry during the german occupation  
24635,an actress she is 
24636,unpaid 
24637,burns is a filmmaker with a bright future ahead of him 
24638,anyone who suffers through this film deserves  at the very least  a big box of consolation candy  
24639, a walk to remember is an inspirational love story  capturing the innocence and idealism of that first encounter  
24640,intermittently good time 
24641,the movie is as padded as allen s jelly belly  
24642,s so simple and precise that anything discordant would topple the balance 
24643,more appealing 
24644,bewilderingly brilliant and 
24645,into the passiveaggressive psychology of codependence and the struggle for selfesteem 
24646,better acted  and far less crass  than some other recent efforts in the burgeoning genre of films about black urban professionals 
24647,just about the best straightup

24660,is likely to find compelling 
24661,as a director  eastwood is off his game  
24662,pleasant enough  and oozing with attractive men 
24663, every member of the ensemble has something fascinating to do  
24664,who feels acting is the heart and soul of cinema 
24665,aniston has at last decisively broken with her friends image in an independent film of satiric fire and emotional turmoil  
24666,ever see one of those comedies that just seem like a bad idea from frame one

24668,the 3d vistas from orbit  with the space station suspended like a huge set of wind chimes over the great blue globe 
24669,lived in a state of quiet desperation 
24670,its cutesy reliance on moviespecific cliches is nt exactly endearing 
24671, t  he script is nt up to the level of the direction  nor are the uneven performances by the cast members  who seem bound and determined to duplicate bela lugosi s nowcliched vampire accent  
24672,downanddirty laugher

24692,some honest insight

24696,lamer instincts 
24697,nicole holofcenter  the insightful writerdirector responsible for this illuminating comedy

24982,incoherence reigns  
24983,make it an aboveaverage thriller 
24984,interview with the assassin is structured less as a documentary and more as a found relic  and as such the film has a difficult time shaking its blair witch project realtime roots

24986,bones tickled 
24987,tells this very compelling tale with little fuss or noise  expertly plucking tension from quiet

25030,broomfield s style of journalism is hardly journalism at all  and even those with an avid interest in the subject will grow impatient 
25031, shock humor  
25032,is one film that s truly deserving of its oscar nomination  
25033,feels as if the movie is more interested in entertaining itself than in amusing us 
25034,with an utterly incompetent conclusion 
25035,considered a star  nor why he keeps being cast in action films when none of them are ever any good 
25036,a strongminded viewpoint  or

25049,the frequent allusions 
25050,the film is not only a love song to the movies but it also is more fully an example of the kind of lush  allenveloping movie experience it rhapsodizes  
25051,exuberant openness 
25052, is so pat it makes your teeth hurt  
25053,you might as well be watching a rerun

25600,a rather simplistic one  grief drives her  love drives him

25606,and good intentions 
25607,feels like a glossy rehash 
25608,pushes too hard 
25609,is that she never lets her character become a caricature  not even with that radioactive hair  
25610,very charming and funny 
25611,seem great to knock back a beer with but they re simply not funny performers 
25612,this is very much of a mixed bag  with enough negatives to outweigh the positives  
25613,sit and stare and turn away from one another instead of talking 
25614,wellacted

25635,along looking for astute observations and coming up blank 
25636, love  
25637,the characters are never more than sketches  which leaves any true emotional connection or identification frustratingly out of reach  
25638,is life affirming and heartbreaking  sweet without the decay factor  funny and sad  
25639,is one of those crass  contrived sequels that not only fails on its own  but makes you secondguess your affection for the original 
25640,seem disappointing 
25641,the face of death 
25642,nature and family warmth 
25643,horrendously 
25644,is a tale worth catching  
25645,the aaa of action  xxx is a blast of adrenalin  rated eee for excitement  
25646,that works as a treatise on spirituality as well as a solid scifi thriller

26951, has thrown every suspenseful cliché in the book at this nonsensical story  
26952,childlike dimness 
26953,terrific casting and 
26954,the least bit ashamed in admitting that my enjoyment came at the expense of seeing justice served  even if it s a dish that s best served cold

26958,wondering why lee s character did nt just go to a bank manager and save everyone the misery 
26959,the movie attempts to mine laughs from a genre  the gangstercrime comedy  that wore out its welcome with audiences several years ago  and its cutesy reliance on moviespecific cliches is nt exactly endearing 
26960,romantic comedy with a fresh point of view just does nt figure in the present hollywood program

26966,we also need movies like tim mccann s revolution no 9  
26967,as a detailed personal portrait and as a rather frightening examination of modern times 
26968,it s a bad action movie because there s no rooting interest and the spectacle is grotesque and boring 
26969,is too amateurishly square to make the most of its own ironic implications 
26970,the wonderfully lush morvern callar is pure punk existentialism 
26971,to see where one s imagination will lead when given the opportunity 
26972,is corcuera s attention to detail

27243, frightening war scenes 
27244,does an established filmmaker so ardently waste viewers  time with a gobbler like this 
27245,who needs mindbending drugs when they can see this  the final part of the  qatsi  trilogy  directed by godfrey reggio  with music by philip glass  
27246,a mere excuse for the wan  thinly sketched story 
27247,the 3d vistas from orbit  with the space station suspended like a huge set of wind chimes over the great blue globe  are stanzas of breathtaking  aweinspiring visual poetry

27274,animation increasingly emphasizes the computer and the cool 
27275,new  or inventive  
27276,twodimensional and pointless 
27277,the action here is unusually tame  the characters are too simplistic to maintain interest  and the plot offers few surprises

27316,pretty well 
27317,completely familiar 
27318,disappointing in comparison to other recent war movies  or any other john woo flick for that matter 
27319,was botched in execution

27325,is rather like being trapped while some weird relative trots out the video he took of the family vacation to stonehenge  
27326,a freshfaced  bighearted and frequently funny thrill 
27327,unfortunately  there is almost nothing in this flat effort that will amuse or entertain them  either  
27328,it just sits there like a side dish no one ordered

27344,as possibly the best actor working in movies today 
27345,boarders from venice beach that was a deserved cowinner of the audience award for documentaries at the sundance film festival  
27346,though there are entertaining and audacious moments  the movie s wildly careening tone and an extremely flat lead performance do little to salvage this filmmaker s flailing reputation  
27347,but it also does the absolute last thing we need hollywood doing to us

27516,desperately 
27517,wrong with performances here 
27518,each story is built on a potentially interesting idea  but the first two are ruined by amateurish writing and acting  while the third feels limited by its short running time  
27519,the character of critical jim twodimensional and pointless

27744,it is that rare combination of bad writing  bad direction and bad acting  the trifecta of badness  
27745,a dull  somnambulant exercise in pretension whose pervasive quiet is broken by frequent outbursts of violence and noise  
27746,are too crude to serve the work especially well 
27747,s  worth the extra effort to see an artist  still committed to growth in his ninth decade  change while remaining true to his principles 
27748,energetic frontman 
27749,so sloppily written 
27750,sand s masculine persona  with its love of life and beauty  takes form

27752,without placing their parents in a comalike state

27762,this bittersweet  uncommonly sincere movie that portrays the frank humanity of  emotional recovery 
27763,completely loveable 
27764,vitality to justify the notion of creating a screen adaptation of evans  saga of hollywood excess

27781,refreshingly unhibited enthusiasm 
27782,for its profound humanity 
27783,as simultaneously funny  offbeat and heartwarming 
27784,but the movie s narrative hook is way too muddled to be an effectively chilling guilty pleasure  
27785,refusal to recognize any of the signposts  as if discovering a way through to the bitter end without a map 
27786,the man from elysian fields is doomed by its smallness 
27787, every bit as imperious as katzenberg s the prince of egypt from 1998  
27788,are just two of the elements that will grab you  
27789,a dashing and resourceful hero  a lisping  reptilian villain  big fights  big hair 
27790,heartfelt and hilarious 
27791,you reach the finale 
27792,easily marketable 
27793,if anything  the film is doing something of a public service  shedding light on a group of extremely talented musicians who might otherwise go unnoticed and underappreciated by music fans  
27794,churn out one mediocre movie 
27795,overall it s an entertaining and informative documentary  
27796,reading lines from a teleprompter 
27797,this picture is murder by numbers  and as easy to be bored by as your abc s  despite a few whopping shootouts  
27798,its oscar nomination 
27799,characteristically engorged 
27800,the performances are so overstated  the effect comes off as selfparody  
27801,s fun  wispy  
27802,for all its problems  the lady and the duke surprisingly manages never to grow boring  which proves that rohmer still has a sense of his audience  
27803,replaced by some dramatic scenes that are jarring and deeply out of place in what could have  and probably should have  been a lighthearted comedy 
27804,complex and honest 
27805,uses modern technology to take the viewer inside the wave 
27806,twohy s a good yarnspinner  and ultimately the story compels  
27807,manipulative claptrap  a periodpiece movieoftheweek  plain old blarney  
27808,an awkwardly garish showcase that diverges from anything 
27809,dumb comedy

27811,drudgery 
27812,stripped almost entirely 
27813,despite all the backstage drama  this is a movie that tells stories that work  is charming  is moving 
27814,to call this one an eventual cult classic would be an understatement  and woe is the horror fan who opts to overlook this goofily endearing and welllensed gorefest 
27815,rowdy slapstick 
27816,that rarity among sequels 
27817,torn away from the compelling historical tale to a lesscompelling soap opera 
27818,the film  flaws and

27823,it has considerable charm  
27824,a work of deft and subtle poetry 
27825,there is nothing distinguishing in a randall wallace film 
27826,integrating the characters in the foreground 
27827,offers no new insight on the matter  nor do its characters exactly spring to life  
27828,as the movie sputters 
27829,embody the worst excesses of nouvelle vague without any of its sense of fun or energy 
27830,manages never to grow boring  which proves that rohmer still has a sense of his audience 
27831,hitman 
27832,an atrociously  mindnumbingly  indescribably bad movie 
27833,approached the usher and said that if she had to sit through it again  she should ask for a raise 
27834,is genial but never inspired  and little about it will stay with you 
27835,is like being trapped at a bad rock concert 
27836,the dry humor that first made audiences on both sides of the atlantic love him 
27837,texan director george ratliff had unlimited access to families and church meetings  and he delivers fascinating psychological fare 
27838,a socalled  comedy  
27839,life that s very different from our own and yet instantly recognizable 
27840,supposed to be a romantic comedy 
27841,living mug shots 
27842,for the most part a useless movie  even with a great director at the helm 
27843,have carved their own comfortable niche in the world 
27844,firstclass road movie 
27845,collective 
27846,an electric pencil sharpener 
27847,loses its fire midway  nearly flickering out by its perfunctory conclusion 
27848,wonderful but sometimes confusing 
27849,if ever such a dependable concept was botched in execution  this is it  
27850,nothing in this flat effort that will amuse or entertain them 
27851,of mindless pace in collision 
27852,be especially grateful for freedom after a film like this 
27853,the effort is sincere 
27854,is an ungainly movie  illfitting  with its elbows sticking out where the knees should be  
27855,the junkcalorie suspense tropes that have all but ruined his career 
27856,works on the whodunit level as its larger themes get lost in the murk of its own making 
27857,the hanukkah spirit seems fried in pork  
27858,deftly sewing together what could have been a confusing and horrifying vision into an intense and engrossing headtrip 
27859,tends to pile too many  serious issues  on its plate at times  yet remains fairly light  always entertaining  and smartly written  
27860,feels free to offend 
27861,fresh point

27871,sexy and romantic

27875,cineasts will revel in those visual injokes  as in the film s verbal pokes at everything from the likes of miramax chief harvey weinstein s bluff personal style to the stylistic rigors of denmark s dogma movement  
27876,quickly enters the pantheon of wreckage that includes battlefield earth and showgirls 
27877,the bigger setpieces flat 
27878,to the junkcalorie suspense tropes that have all but ruined his career 
27879,cause you to bite your tongue to keep from laughing at the ridiculous dialog or the ohso convenient plot twists  
27880,need to be invented to describe exactly how bad it is  
27881,a cleareyed portrait of an intensely lived time  filled with nervous energy  moral ambiguity and great uncertainties 
27882,witty updatings  silver s parrot has been replaced with morph  a cute alien creature who mimics everyone and everything around  
27883,adroit 
27884,may lack the pungent bite of its title  but it s an enjoyable trifle nonetheless  
27885,s unfortunate that wallace  who wrote gibson s braveheart as well as the recent pearl harbor  has such an irrepressible passion for sappy situations and dialogue 
27886,the national lampoon film franchise 
27887,s immensely ambitious  different than anything that s been done before and amazingly successful in terms of what it s trying to do 
27888,would imagine  as searching for a quarter in a giant pile of elephant feces  positively dreadful 
27889,match the ordeal of sitting through it 
27890,the type of dumbeddown exercise in stereotypes that gives the  teen comedy  
27891,fit 
27892,thoughtless  random  superficial humor and a lot

27914,a full experience  a love story and a murder mystery that expands into a meditation on the deep deceptions of innocence 
27915,scratching your head 
27916,to sit through about 90 minutes of a socalled  comedy  and not laugh once 
27917,a lump of runofthemill profanity 
27918,all comes together to create a very compelling  sensitive  intelligent and almost cohesive piece of film entertainment 
27919,of the biggest disappointments of the year

27942,effortlessly 
27943,quirky movie 
27944,a very good time at the cinema 
27945,this utterly ridiculous shaggy dog story as one of the most creative  energetic and original comedies to hit the screen in years 
27946,real magic 
27947,with nary a glimmer of selfknowledge   crane  becomes more specimen than character  and 
27948, the film does pack some serious suspense  
27949,after an 88minute ripoff of the rock 
27950,is long on glamour and short on larger moralistic consequences  
27951,this nicely wound clock not just ticking  but humming 
27952,an exceptionally acted  quietly affecting cop drama  
27953, this story gets sillier  not scarier  as it goes along  
27954,when the screenwriter responsible for one of the worst movies of one year directs an equally miserable film the following year 
27955,supposedly funny movie 
27956,in their own idiosyncratic way  sum up the strange horror of life in the new millennium 
27957,recommend it  because it overstays its natural running time 
27958, life affirming  
27959,is a mormon family movie  and a sappy  preachy one at that 
27960,masochistic moviegoers 
27961,that you never want to see another car chase  explosion or gunfight again

27976,understand everyone s point of view 
27977,makes a great impression as the writerdirector of this little  18 million charmer  which may not be cuttingedge indie filmmaking but 
27978,through this film 
27979,imponderably stilted and selfconsciously arty movie 
27980,mindless action movie 
27981,the story of trouble every day  is so sketchy it amounts to little more than preliminary notes for a sciencefiction horror film  and the movie s fragmentary narrative style makes piecing the story together frustrating difficult 
27982,quite sure where selfpromotion ends and the truth begins 
27983,the plot so bland that even as rogue cia assassins working for chris cooper s agency boss close in on the resourceful amnesiac  we do nt feel much for damonbourne or his predicament 
27984,even as it points out how inseparable the two are 
27985,provides the kind of  laugh therapy  i need from movie comedies  
27986,the big shear 
27987, swimfan  falls victim to sloppy plotting  an insultingly unbelievable final act and a villainess who is too crazy to be interesting  
27988,the film buzz and whir 
27989,there s something there

27994,frantic than involving  
27995,big fat liar is a real charmer 
27996,manipulative and as bland as wonder bread dipped in milk  but it also does the absolute last thing we need hollywood doing to us  it preaches  
27997,she looks like the sixtime winner of the miss hawaiian tropic pageant  so i do nt know what she s doing in here 
27998,a satisfactory overview of the bizarre world of extreme athletes as several daredevils

28003,fantastically vital 
28004,sodden and glum  even in those moments where it s supposed to feel funny and light  
28005,while some will object to the idea of a vietnam picture with such a rahrah  patriotic tone  soldiers ultimately achieves its main strategic objective  dramatizing the human cost of the conflict that came to define a generation  
28006,its storytelling prowess and special effects 
28007,idiots who do nt care what kind of sewage they shovel into their mental gullets to simulate sustenance 
28008,slow down  shake off your tensions and take this picture at its own breezy  distracted rhythms 
28009,a grand picture of an era

28019,little action

28021,reallife happening 
28022,found myself growing more and more frustrated and detached as vincent became more and more abhorrent  
28023,a spectacular performance  ahem 
28024,what should have been a cutting hollywood satire is instead about as fresh as last week s issue of variety  
28025,as i settled into my world war ii memories  i found myself strangely moved by even the corniest and most hackneyed contrivances  
28026,dedicated artists 
28027,unengaging

28183,the end result does no justice to the story itself 
28184,any film that does nt even in passing mention political prisoners  poverty and the boat loads of people who try to escape the country is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss

28250,really sets the film apart is debrauwer s refusal to push the easy emotional buttons 
28251,above much of the director s previous popcorn work

28667,unless you re an absolute raving star wars junkie  it is nt much fun  
28668,it s a spirited film and a mustsee 
28669,an offbeat and fanciful film about the human need for monsters to blame for all that is amiss in the world  
28670,an essentially awkward version of the lightweight female empowerment picture we ve been watching for decades 
28671,been developed with more care

28684,adequately 
28685,at least one damn fine horror movie 
28686,the characters are paper thin and the plot is so cliched and contrived that it makes your least favorite james bond movie seem as cleverly plotted as the usual suspects

28688,s in danger of going wrong

28727,spoofs 
28728,enjoyable above average summer diversion 
28729,you like an extreme actionpacked film with a hint of humor 
28730, then this first film to use a watercolor background since  dumbo  certainly ranks as the most original in years  
28731,the screenplay by james eric  james horton and director peter ofallon  is so pat it makes your teeth hurt  
28732,if i could have looked into my future and saw how bad this movie was  i would go back and choose to skip it  
28733,takes itself all too seriously 
28734,hmmm  might i suggest that the wayward wooden one end it all by stuffing himself into an electric pencil sharpener  
28735,story to show us why it s compelling

28744,likely to cause massive cardiac arrest if taken in large doses 
28745,a comedic context 
28746,with a tighter editorial process and firmer direction this material could work  especially since the actresses in the lead roles are all more than competent 
28747,try this obscenely bad dark comedy  so crass that it makes edward burns  sidewalks of new york look like oscar wilde

28753,the allfrench cast is marveilleux  
28754,the worst film

28823,by a noticeable lack of pace 
28824,carry the film with their charisma 
28825,the fact that the  best part  of the movie comes from a 60second homage to one of demme s good films does nt bode well for the rest of it  
28826,at least during their 70s heyday 
28827,most original 
28828,s about as convincing as any other arnie musclefest 
28829,as cleverly plotted as the usual suspects 
28830,has the charisma of a young woman who knows how to hold the screen

28949,the poor acting by the ensemble cast  the flat dialogue by vincent r nebrida or the gutless direction by laurice guillen 
28950,lack depth or complexity  with the ironic exception of scooter  
28951,s pretentious in a way that verges on the amateurish

28990,are both excellent  in the kind of lowkey way that allows us to forget that they are actually movie folk 
28991,he drags it back  singlehanded  
28992,whose achievements  and complexities  
28993,too bad 
28994,its limit to sustain a laugh

29044,this is a film that manages to find greatness in the hue of its drastic iconography  
29045,a cleareyed chronicle of a female friendship that is more complex and honest than anything represented in a hollywood film 
29046,of a creaky  pretty woman  retread  with the emphasis on selfempowering schmaltz and bigwave surfing that gives pic its title an afterthought 
29047,plays like some corny television production from a bygone era 
29048,more than makes up for in drama  suspense  revenge  and romance

29057,if you are curious to see the darker side of what s going on with young tv actors  dawson leery did what    or see some interesting storytelling devices  you might want to check it out  but there s nothing very attractive about this movie

29064,re simply not funny performers 
29065,which also seems to play on a 10year delay 
29066,that makes the formula fresh again

29262,scratching your head than hiding under your seat 
29263,delicious crime drama 
29264,grating and tedious 
29265,instead of a witty expose on the banality and hypocrisy of too much kidvid 
29266,an example of quiet  confident craftsmanship that tells a sweet  charming tale of intergalactic friendship  
29267,dull 
29268,plainly dull 
29269,crush could be the worst film a man has made about women since valley of the dolls

29297,spiffy bluescreen technique and 
29298,may not be a breakthrough in filmmaking  
29299,capturing the precarious balance between the extravagant confidence of the exiled aristocracy and the cruel earnestness of the victorious revolutionaries 
29300,engages us in constant fits of laughter  until we find ourselves surprised at how much we care about the story 
29301,goodnaturedly cornball sequel

29338,sixtiesstyle slickness in which the hero might wind up 
29339,the most original american productions 
29340,an unholy mess  driven by the pathetic idea that if you shoot something on crummylooking videotape  it must be labeled  hip    innovative  and  realistic   
29341,payami graphically illustrates the problems of fledgling democracies  but also the strength and sense of freedom the iranian people already possess  with or without access to the ballot box  
29342,the genius of the work 
29343,truly terrible 
29344,painting an unabashedly romantic picture of a nation whose songs spring directly from the lives of the people 
29345,presiding over the end of cinema as we know it and

29362,is that  by the end  no one in the audience or the film seems to really care  
29363,with an obvious rapport with her actors and a striking style behind the camera 
29364,us love it  too  
29365,the effort is sincere and 
29366,badly edited  91minute trailer

29399,enriched by an imaginatively mixed cast of antic spirits  
29400,there is a subversive element to this disney cartoon  providing unexpected fizzability

29422,execrable  
29423,perhaps the grossest movie 
29424,sentimentalizing 
29425,appears to have been made by people to whom the idea of narrative logic or cohesion is an entirely foreign concept 
29426,you wo nt be talking about the film once you exit the theater 
29427,murphy and wilson actually make a pretty good team  but the project surrounding them is distressingly rote

30073,his girl friday   maintaining a light touch while tackling serious themes 
30074,to break free of her old life 
30075,these days are about nothing 
30076,terrific casting 
30077,it feels like very light errol morris  focusing on eccentricity but failing  ultimately  to make something bigger out of its scrapbook of oddballs  
30078,their consistently sensitive and often exciting treatment 
30079,is the kathie lee gifford of film directors  sadly proving once again ego does nt always go hand in hand with talent 
30080,emphasizing the disappointingly generic nature of the entire effort 
30081,auto focus bears out as your typical junkie opera  
30082,stoked to make an important film about human infidelity and happenstance that he tosses a kitchen sink onto a story already overladen with plot conceits 
30083,technically proficient and 
30084,a chilly  brooding but quietly 
30085,lazy exercise

30090,underinspired  overblown enterprise 
30091,like a milquetoast movie of the week blown up for the big screen 
30092,inject farcical raunch 
30093,injects freshness and spirit into the romantic comedy genre  which has been held hostage by generic scripts that seek to remake sleepless in seattle again and again

30095,will wish there had been more of the  queen  and less of the  damned  
30096,a fascinating  unnerving examination of the delusions of one unstable man  
30097,is one of the best actors there is 
30098,is completely serviceable and quickly forgettable 
30099,a remarkably cohesive whole  both visually and thematically  
30100,is that it also makes her appear foolish and shallow rather than  as was more likely  a victim of mental illness  
30101,ugly and destructive 
30102,baaaaaaaaad movie

30111,crane s decline with unblinking candor 
30112,written a more credible script  though with the same number of continuity errors 
30113,sure to give you a lot of laughs in this simple  sweet and romantic comedy 
30114,more of  spirit  perception  conviction 
30115,the gags that fly at such a furiously funny pace that the only rip off that we were aware of was the one we felt when the movie ended so damned soon  
30116,teethclenching 
30117,the movie is brilliant  really  
30118,entertainingly reenacting a historic scandal

30122,barely realize your mind is being blown  
30123,light nor magical enough to bring off this kind of whimsy 
30124, a  stale retread of the 53 original  
30125,of the most gloriously unsubtle and adrenalized extreme 
30126,abhorrent 
30127,feels painfully redundant and inauthentic 
30128,make it well worth watching 
30129,after the first 10 minutes  which is worth seeing  the movie sinks into an abyss of clichés  depression and bad alternative music  
30130,integrating the characters 
30131,brave and 
30132,in an increasingly important film industry and worth the look 
30133,modestly surprising movie

30135,they ca nt generate enough heat in this cold vacuum of a comedy to start a reaction  
30136,wondrous beats 
30137,a predictably efficient piece of business notable largely for its overwhelming creepiness  for an eagerness to create images you wish you had nt seen 
30138,to truly care for its decrepit freaks beyond the promise of a reprieve from their incessant whining 
30139,ability to shock and amaze 
30140,another tired old vision 
30141,a fascinating character s 
30142,by way too much indulgence of scenechewing  teethgnashing actorliness 
30143,a tough pill to swallow 
30144,more adventurous 
30145,than a stylish exercise in revisionism whose point 
30146,too many scenarios in which the hero might have an opportunity to triumphantly sermonize  and too few that allow us to wonder for ourselves if things will turn out okay  
30147,rings false 
30148,sustains the level of exaggerated  stylized humor throughout by taking your expectations and twisting them just a bit 
30149,human nature  in short  is nt nearly as funny as it thinks it is  
30150,more than their unique residences 
30151, strips bible stores of the potential for sanctimoniousness  making them meaningful for both kids and churchwary adults  
30152,not even felinni would know what to make of this italian freakshow

30154,the flowering of the south korean cinema 
30155, and lovely  experiment 
30156,george and lucy s most obvious differences to ignite sparks 
30157,a sensitive  moving  brilliantly constructed work  
30158,undeniably fascinating and playful 
30159,too polite to scale the lunatic heights of joe dante s similarly styled gremlins 
30160,crafted a deceptively casual ode to children and managed to convey a tiny sense of hope 
30161,this stinker 
30162,piercing and feisty 
30163,is one of my least favorite emotions  especially when i have to put up with 146 minutes of it 
30164,before it collapses into exactly the kind of buddy cop comedy it set out to lampoon  anyway  
30165,not to mention mysterious  sensual  emotionally intense  and replete with virtuoso throatsinging  
30166,urban comedy 
30167,exalts the marxian dream of honest working folk 
30168,is a brilliant movie

30179,reyes  directorial debut has good things to offer  but ultimately it s undone by a sloppy script 
30180, b  
30181,one of france s most inventive directors 
30182,sets a new benchmark for lameness  
30183,in comparison to his earlier films it seems a disappointingly thin slice of lowerclass london life  despite the title  amounts to surprisingly little  
30184,tenacious

30205,its empty head

30207, this retooled machine is ultimately effective enough at achieving the modest  crowdpleasing goals it sets for itself  
30208,a remarkably alluring film 
30209,for sure 
30210,a fun and funky look 
30211,have been more enjoyable had the balance shifted in favor of waterbound action over the landbased  drama 
30212,has failed him 
30213,for everyone 
30214,rather unique approach 
30215,is oscarworthy 
30216,watching intelligent people making a movie 
30217,the modern master 
30218,a superfluous sequel  plagued by that old familiar feeling of  let s get this thing over with   everyone has shown up at the appointed time and place  but visible enthusiasm is mighty hard to find  
30219,is an interesting story of pointed personalities  courage  tragedy and the little guys vs the big guys 
30220, like a rather unbelievable love interest and a meandering ending  
30221,warped 
30222,launch 
30223,as if a bored cage spent the duration of the film s shooting schedule waiting to scream   got aids yet 
30224,one that was hard for me to warm up to 
30225,brought down by lousy direction  
30226,an even less capable trio of criminals 
30227,be greek to anyone not predisposed to the movie s rude and crude humor 
30228,for the last 15 minutes 
30229,a superfluous sequel  
30230,too convoluted 
30231,with few respites  marshall keeps the energy humming  and his edits  unlike those in moulin rouge  are crisp and purposeful without overdoing it  
30232,the pictures do the punching 
30233,terrific casting and solid execution 
30234,thrillers actually thrilled 
30235,is the sense that peace is possible

30239,spellbinding serpent s 
30240,becomes more and more frustrating as the film goes on 
30241,funniest motion 
30242,fondly remembered as roman coppola s brief pretentious period before going on to other films that actually tell a story worth caring about 
30243,the stale plot and pornographic way 
30244,handles the nuclear crisis sequences evenly but milks drama when she should be building suspense  and drags out too many scenes toward the end that should move quickly 
30245,is better than any summer blockbuster we had to endure last summer  and hopefully  sets the tone for a summer of good stuff  
30246,ebullient 
30247,takes care with the characters  who are so believable that you feel what they feel

30284,with all the mounting tension of an expert thriller 
30285,formulaic and forgettable 
30286,you have some idea of the glum  numb experience of watching o fantasma 
30287,effectively combines two surefire  beloved genres 
30288,with muscles and a lot more smarts  but just as endearing and easy to watch 
30289,candid  
30290,you may be galled that you ve wasted nearly two hours of your own precious life with this silly little puddle of a movie  
30291,hardcore slasher aficionados will find things to like

30293,this turd squashed 
30294,showstoppingly hilarious  
30295,director chris columbus takes a hatinhand approach to rowling that stifles creativity and allows the film to drag on for nearly three hours

30297,right conditions 
30298,s film  in the worst sense of the expression  
30299,godard s ode to tackling life s wonderment is a rambling and incoherent manifesto about the vagueness of topical excess

30311,presume 
30312,you ve got to admire  the intensity with which he s willing to express his convictions 
30313,the best didacticism is one carried by a strong sense of humanism  and bertrand tavernier s oftbrilliant safe conduct   laissezpasser   wears its heart on its sleeve  
30314,found the movie as divided against itself as the dysfunctional family it portrays  
30315,shamelessly manipulative and contrived 
30316,lazy tearjerker that gives movies about ordinary folk a bad name

30529,the film is filled with humorous observations about the general absurdity of modern life as seen through the eyes outsiders 
30530,the crassness of this reactionary thriller is matched only by the ridiculousness of its premise  
30531,this is a remarkably accessible and haunting film  
30532,this charming but slight tale 
30533, and peopled mainly by characters so unsympathetic that you re left with a sour taste in your mouth

30553,lightweight but appealing  
30554,its courage  
30555,feeling like you ve completely lowered your entertainment standards 
30556,makes it interesting as a character study is the fact that the story is told from paul s perspective 
30557,mr wollter and ms seldhal give strong and convincing performances  but neither reaches into the deepest recesses of the character to unearth the quaking essence of passion  grief and fear 
30558,ambiguous enough to be engaging 
30559,it holds itself 
30560,with overall feelings  broader ideas  and openended questions than concrete story and definitive answers

30593,a party political broadcast 
30594,dumb high school comedy 
30595,an acceptable way to pass a little over an hour with moviegoers ages 810  but it s unlikely to inspire anything more than a visit to mcdonald s  let alone some savvy street activism

31244,do nt say you were nt warned 
31245,sit through a crummy  wannabehip crime comedy that refers incessantly to old movies  when you could just rent those movies instead  let alone seek out a respectable new one  
31246,this wretchedly unfunny wannabe comedy 
31247,cedar somewhat defuses this provocative theme by submerging it in a hoary love triangle  
31248,everett remains a perfect wildean actor 
31249,the essence of magic 
31250,i liked about it 
31251,grownup film 
31252,as a director  eastwood is off his game  there s no real sense of suspense  and none of the plot  surprises  are really surprising  
31253,a rare and lightly entertaining 
31254,stuffy  full of itself  
31255,particularly innovative 
31256,the work of an artist tormented by his heritage  using his storytelling ability to honor the many faceless victims  
31257,is enough to give you brain strain 
31258,its moving story 
31259,to ride the big metaphorical wave that is life  wherever it takes you 
31260,often contradictory 
31261,leavened by a charm that s conspicuously missing from the girls  bigscreen blowout 
31262,very touching 
31263,gentle  mesmerizing 
31264,as appalling as any  comedy  
31265,a passionately inquisitive film 
31266,a glib but bouncy bit 
31267, assayas   homage to the gallic  tradition of quality 
31268,a disappointingly thin slice of lowerclass london life  despite the title 
31269,  michael moore gives us the perfect starting point for a national conversation about guns  violence  and fear  
31270,awfully good  achingly human picture 
31271,thrills and extreme

31276,sharp as the original 
31277,desperate attempt 
31278,petty thievery like this that puts flimsy flicks like this behind bars 
31279,dangerous 
31280,spirals downward  and thuds to the bottom of the pool with an utterly incompetent conclusion 
31281,living far too much in its own head 
31282,most magical and 
31283,is certainly easy to watch  
31284,well paced and satisfying 
31285,in fact  it s quite fun in places  
31286,terminally bland  painfully slow and needlessly confusing  the movie  shot on digital videotape rather than film  is frequently indecipherable  
31287,is definitely meaningless  vapid and devoid 
31288,comes at film with bracing intelligence and a vision both painterly and literary  
31289,may pick up new admirers

31291,in marriage 
31292,breathes life into a roll that could have otherwise been bland and run of the mill  
31293,hard to understand 
31294,turn this fairly parochial melodrama into something really rather special 
31295,to keep letting go at all the wrong moments 
31296,fails to live up to  or offer any new insight into  its chosen topic 
31297,if it s filmed tosca that you want

31313,niccol the filmmaker merges his collaborators  symbolic images with his words  insinuating  for example  that in hollywood  only god speaks to the press 
31314,moving and weighty 
31315,catch it  if you can 
31316,so muddled  repetitive and ragged that it says far less about the horrifying historical reality than about the filmmaker s characteristic style  
31317,times when the film s reach exceeds its grasp 
31318,gives his best screen performance with an oddly winning portrayal of one of life s ultimate losers  
31319,retelling a historically significant  and personal  episode 
31320,thought through than in most  rightthinking  films 
31321,s a drag how nettelbeck sees working women  or at least this working woman  for whom she shows little understanding  
31322,little melodramatic  but with 
31323,now and then without in any way demeaning its subjects 
31324,vividly conveys the passion  creativity  and fearlessness of one of mexico s most colorful and controversial artists  a captivating drama that will speak to the nonconformist in us all  
31325,attal s hangups surrounding infidelity are so oldfashioned 
31326,how admirably 
31327,starts off so bad 
31328,punctuated by flying guts 
31329,fails on its own  but makes you secondguess your affection for the original 
31330,could feel my eyelids  getting  very  heavy

31341,a summer of teendriven  toilethumor codswallop 
31342,the following things are not at all entertaining  the bad sound  the lack of climax and  worst of all  watching seinfeld  who is also one of the film s producers  do everything he can to look like a good guy  
31343,mention inappropriate and wildly undeserved 
31344,presented with great sympathy and intelligence 
31345,this is one summer film that satisfies 
31346,to the point of ridiculousness 
31347,like a term paper 
31348,an overly familiar scenario is made fresh by an intelligent screenplay and gripping performances in this lowbudget  videoshot  debut indie effort  
31349,with sensitivity and skill 
31350,s hard to imagine another director ever making his wife look so bad in a major movie  
31351,to hang broad  mildly fleshedout characters that seem to have been conjured up only 10 minutes prior to filming 
31352,falls back on too many triedandtrue shenanigans that hardly distinguish it from the next teen comedy  
31353,an inexpressible and drab wannabe 
31354, never rises above the level of a telanovela  
31355,has its redundancies 
31356,as in aimless  arduous  and arbitrary  
31357,sparkling  often hilarious romantic jealousy comedy  attal looks so much like a young robert deniro that it seems the film should instead be called  my husband is travis bickle  
31358,contrived and predictable

31367,wellcrafted film 
31368,that have all but ruined his career

31370,this is even better than the fellowship  
31371,is still charming 
31372,wonderful cinematography

31382,wellwritten and occasionally challenging social drama 
31383, a quietly introspective portrait of the selfesteem of employment and the shame of losing a job 
31384,proof once again that if the filmmakers just follow the books 
31385,s muy loco  but no more ridiculous than most of the rest of  dragonfly  
31386,with promise 
31387,reel in the audience 
31388,the concert footage is stirring 
31389,clean and 
31390,less mature 
31391,horrible movie 
31392,to inject farcical raunch 
31393,the lazy material and the finished product s unshapely look 
31394,in this sense the movie becomes a study of the gambles of the publishing world  offering a case study that exists apart from all the movie s political ramifications 
31395,could hardly ask for more 
31396,graceful dual narrative 
31397,to ask people to sit still for two hours and change watching such a character  especially when rendered in as flat and impassive a manner as phoenix s 
31398,a listless climb 
31399,involved  
31400,among the many pleasures 
31401,combines psychological drama  sociological reflection  and highoctane thriller

31405,strength and sense

31407,is quite beautiful 
31408,is playful but highly studied and dependent for its success on a patient viewer 
31409,virtually plotless 
31410,as if solondz had two ideas for two movies  could nt really figure out how to flesh either out 
31411,a thoughtprovoking and oftenfunny drama about isolation 
31412,is notable for its sheer audacity and openness  
31413,you wish he d gone the way of don simpson 
31414,throws in too many conflicts to keep the story compelling 
31415,that even he seems embarrassed to be part of 
31416,sickeningly real 
31417,radical action 
31418,complete shambles 
31419,whiny  pathetic  starving and untalented

31427,story to suit the sensibilities of a young american  a decision that plucks  the four feathers  
31428,if it had just gone that one step further 
31429,a persuasive 
31430, this is one adapted  fromtelevision movie that actually looks as if it belongs on the big screen

31447,such a good job of it 
31448,is the drama within the drama 
31449,and thanks to kline s superbly nuanced performance  that pondering is highly pleasurable  
31450,that rare movie that works on any number of levels  as a film of magic and whimsy for children  a heartfelt romance for teenagers and a compelling argument about death  both pro and con  for adults  
31451,their sexual and romantic tension  while never really vocalized  is palpable

31455,as crisp and to the point 
31456,wears its empowerment 
31457,greatly impressed by the skill of the actors involved in the enterprise 
31458, a low rate annie featuring some kid who ca nt act  only echoes of jordan  and weirdo actor crispin glover screwing things up old school  
31459,the punch lines 
31460,imagine a film that begins as a seven ripoff  only to switch to a mix of the shining  the thing  and any naked teenagers horror flick from the 1980s  
31461,a generic international version 
31462,visually masterful work 
31463,grows boring despite the scenery 
31464,wannabe film  
31465,need to adhere more closely to the laws of laughter 
31466,the best sports movie i ve ever seen  
31467,love sweetly 
31468,the movie does nt add anything fresh to the myth  
31469,obsessively 
31470, it s a very very strong  b    
31471,made a more sheerly beautiful film 
31472,there is simply not enough of interest onscreen to sustain its seventyminute running time  
31473,a lovely film for the holiday season  
31474,that make williams sink into melancholia 
31475,skins has a desolate air  but eyre  a native american raised by white parents  manages to infuse the rocky path to sibling reconciliation with flashes of warmth and gentle humor  
31476,in other words  it s badder than bad  
31477,messing 
31478,dabbles all around 
31479,cacoyannis  vision is far less mature  interpreting the play as a call for pity and sympathy for anachronistic phantasms haunting the imagined glory of their own pasts  
31480, scratch is great fun  full of the kind of energy it s documenting  
31481,merely bad rather than 
31482,the strain of its plot contrivances 
31483,by annesophie birot 
31484,have nt seen such selfamused trash since freddy got fingered  
31485,strangely 
31486,a surgeon mends a broken heart  very meticulously but without any passion 
31487,banterfilled comedy

31491,hurried  badly cobbled look 
31492,know what it wants to be 
31493,to make the film relevant today  without fully understanding what it was that made the story relevant in the first place 
31494,adds substantial depth to this shocking testament to antisemitism and neofascism 
31495,is so thoughtlessly assembled  
31496,the kind of art shots that fill gallery shows 
31497,are simply named the husband  the wife and the kidnapper  emphasizing the disappointingly generic nature of the entire effort 
31498,smug or sanctimonious 
31499,just lazy 
31500,is like sitting in a downtown café  overhearing a bunch of typical latetwentysomethings natter on about nothing  and desperately wishing you could change tables 
31501,to the annoying score to  special effects  by way of replacing objects in a character s hands below the camera line 
31502,intentionally introducing your kids to films which will cause loads of irreparable damage that years and years of costly analysis could never fix 
31503,intriguing and realistic 
31504,no matter how much he runs around and acts like a doofus  accepting a 50yearold in the role is creepy in a michael jackson sort of way  
31505,be better as a diary or documentary 
31506,this man so watchable is a tribute not only to his craft  but to his legend 
31507,filming the teeming life 
31508,is hampered by its predictable plot and paperthin supporting characters 
31509,landmark as monumental as disney s 1937 breakthrough snow white and the seven dwarfs 
31510,romp that will have viewers guessing just who s being conned right up to the finale 
31511,everything meshes in this elegant entertainment 
31512,tosses around sex toys and offers halfhearted paeans to empowerment 
31513,hampered by taylor s cartoonish performance and the film s illconsidered notion 
31514,enjoy more because you re one of the lucky few who sought it out 
31515,disappointingly 
31516,a badly edited  91minute trailer 
31517,throughout all the tumult  a question comes to mind  so why is this so boring  
31518,whether jason x is this bad on purpose 
31519,the pleasure of watching them 
31520,impossible 
31521,but it also does the absolute last thing we need hollywood doing to us  it preaches 
31522,the new insomnia is a surprisingly faithful remake of its chilly predecessor  and when it does elect to head off in its own direction  it employs changes that fit it well rather than ones that were imposed for the sake of commercial sensibilities 
31523,should make it required viewing in university computer science departments for years to come  
31524,the explosion essentially ruined  or  rather  overpowered  the fiction of the movie for me 
31525,the actors  perfect comic timing and 
31526,different than anything that s been done before 
31527,paean 
31528,a surprisingly  solid  achievement by director 
31529,in the way they help increase an average student s selfesteem 
31530,s too interested in jerking off in all its byzantine incarnations to bother pleasuring its audience 
31531,is just fine 
31532, endearing  masterful 
31533,intriguing  provocative 
31534,unnoticed and underappreciated 
31535,satisfying complete picture 
31536,a confident  richly acted  emotionally devastating piece of work and 2002 s first great film 
31537,sublimely beautiful 
31538,that real natural  evenflowing tone 
31539,hold dear about cinema  only now it s begun to split up so that it can do even more damage 
31540,the conventional sciencefiction elements of bugeyed monsters and futuristic women in skimpy clothes 
31541,what sets this romantic comedy apart from most hollywood romantic comedies is its lowkey way of tackling what seems like donetodeath material  
31542,is hartley s least accessible screed yet 
31543,is offset by the sheer ugliness of everything else 
31544,suited to a night in the living room than a night at the movies 
31545,encumbers itself with complications 
31546,for in drama  suspense  revenge  and romance 
31547,he keeps being cast in action films when none of them are ever any good 
31548,that gave people seizures 
31549,a wise and powerful tale of race and culture forcefully told  with superb performances throughout 
31550,horribly wrong 
31551,a beautiful film  
31552, it s robert duvall  
31553,to resemble the kind of softcore twaddle you d expect to see on showtime s  red shoe diaries 
31554,speaks volumes  offering up a hallucinatory dreamscape that frustrates and captivates 
31555,woven together handsomely 
31556,to cause massive cardiac arrest if taken in large doses 
31557,to imagine anybody ever being  in the mood  to view a movie as harrowing and painful as the grey zone 
31558,the verdict  two bodies and hardly a laugh between them 
31559,kooky which should appeal to women 
31560,hand it to director george clooney 
31561,is an odd but ultimately satisfying blend of the sophomoric and the sublime 
31562,the only pain you ll feel as the credits roll is your stomach grumbling for some tasty grub  
31563,maddeningly 
31564,complain that  they do nt make movies like they used to anymore 
31565,a manipulative whitewash 
31566,the film presents visceral and dangerously honest revelations about the men and machines behind the curtains of our planet  
31567,at the very root of his contradictory  selfhating  selfdestructive ways 
31568,making kahlo s art a living  breathing part of the movie  often 
31569,more confused  less interesting and more 
31570,portrays their cartoon counterparts well  
31571,much of the action takes place 
31572,a worldlywise and very funny script 
31573,the whole affair  true story or not  feels incredibly hokey   it  comes off like a hallmark commercial  
31574,a terrible adaptation 
31575,revealing nothing 
31576,is a tart  smart breath of fresh air 
31577,what s most memorable about circuit is that it s shot on digital video  whose tiny camera enables shafer to navigate spaces both large  and small  with considerable aplomb  
31578,love s 
31579,marvel at the sometimes murky  always brooding look of i 
31580,thanks to the château s balance of whimsicality  narrative discipline and serious improvisation 
31581,lends the setting the ethereal beauty of an asian landscape painting 
31582,an overflowing septic tank 
31583,penetrating  potent exploration 
31584,must have read  seeking anyone with acting ambition but no sense of pride or shame   
31585,be said for a studioproduced film that never bothers to hand viewers a suitcase full of easy answers 
31586,prefabricated story elements 
31587,musical numbers 
31588,of loving 
31589,i thought the relationships were wonderful  
31590, interest can not be revived  
31591,outside of burger s desire to make some kind of film  it s really unclear why this project was undertaken 
31592,is cumbersome 
31593,a calculating fiend or 
31594,this deeply affecting film 
31595,then knock yourself out and enjoy the big screen postcard that is a selfglorified martin lawrence lovefest  
31596,payne has created a beautiful canvas  
31597,equals the sum of its pretensions 
31598,s not very well shot or composed or edited 
31599,parris  performance is credible and remarkably mature  
31600,wickedly funny 
31601,lackluster thriller  new best friend  
31602,cruel and inhuman cinematic punishment  simultaneously degrades its characters  its stars and its audience  
31603,of almost bergmanesque intensity 
31604,a sharp movie 
31605,s amusing enough while you watch it  offering fine acting moments and pungent insights into modern la s showbiz and media 
31606, you re likely wondering why you ve been watching all this strutting and posturing  
31607,the movie is loaded with good intentions  but in his zeal to squeeze the action and our emotions into the alltoofamiliar dramatic arc of the holocaust escape story  minac drains his movie of all individuality  
31608,positively thrilling combination 
31609,energy and geniality 
31610,same time to congratulate himself for having the guts to confront it 
31611,split up so that it can do even more damage 
31612,high crimes steals so freely from other movies and combines enough disparate types of films that it ca nt help but engage an audience  
31613,for proof of that on the cinematic front  look no further than this 20th anniversary edition of the film that spielberg calls 
31614,the year s greatest adventure  and jackson s limited but enthusiastic adaptation 
31615,the lively intelligence 
31616,reasonably intelligent 
31617,until its final minutes this is a perceptive study of two families in crisis  and of two girls whose friendship is severely tested by bad luck and their own immaturity  
31618,it may not be a great piece of filmmaking  but its power comes from its soul s  eye view of how wellmeaning patronizing masked a social injustice  at least as represented by this case 
31619,is way too muddled to be an effectively chilling guilty pleasure 
31620,warm in its loving yet unforgivingly inconsistent depiction of everyday people  relaxed in its perfect quiet pace and proud in its message  
31621,just sneers 
31622,inspirational prepschool professors

31633,the dead  water  weight of the other 
31634,fallen 
31635,rude and crude humor 
31636,can both maintain and dismantle the facades that his genre and his character construct is a wonderous accomplishment of veracity and narrative grace

32038,as a catalyst for the struggle of black manhood in restrictive and chaotic america  sketchy but nevertheless gripping portrait of jim brown  a celebrated wonder in the spotlight 
32039,leave it to the french to truly capture the terrifying angst of the modern working man without turning the film into a cheap thriller  a dumb comedy or a sappy melodrama

32057,a reasonable degree 
32058,first and foremost  the reason to go see  blue crush  is the phenomenal  waterborn cinematography by david hennings

32081,after all  it ll probably be in video stores by christmas  and it might just be better suited to a night in the living room than a night at the movies

32122,the work of a filmmaker who has secrets buried at the heart of his story and knows how to take time revealing them 
32123,in many ways a conventional  even predictable remake 
32124,as the worst kind of hubristic folly 
32125,here his sense of story and his juvenile camera movements smack of a film school undergrad  and his maudlin ending might not have gotten him into film school in the first place

32152,go rent  shakes the clown   a much funnier film with a similar theme and an equally great robin williams performance

32435,like the work of someone 
32436,strikes hardest 
32437, the kid s  just too bratty for sympathy  and 
32438,is an undeniably intriguing film from an adventurous young talent who finds his inspiration on the fringes of the american underground  
32439,mainstream audiences will find little of interest in this film  which is often preachy and poorly acted  
32440,inelegant 
32441,gedeck 
32442,or  suck  
32443,like the chilled breath of oral storytelling frozen onto film  
32444,succumbs to gravity and plummets

32446,comes across as shallow and glib though not meanspirited 
32447,provides a window into a subculture hellbent on expressing itself in every way imaginable  
32448, sarah s dedication to finding her husband seems more psychotic than romantic  and nothing in the movie makes a convincing case that one woman s broken heart outweighs all the loss we witness  
32449,green ruins every single scene he s in  and the film  while it s not completely wreaked  is seriously compromised by that 
32450,s a bad sign when you re rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects  deaths just so the documentary will be over 
32451,that he s made at least one damn fine horror movie 
32452,comes across as stick figures reading lines from a teleprompter 
32453,various amusing sidekicks 
32454,deeply out of place in what could have

32469,timely and

32472,be bad 
32473,evolved from star to superstar some time over the past year  which means that birthday girl is the kind of quirkily appealing minor movie she might not make for a while  
32474, point and purpose 
32475,put together by some cynical creeps at revolution studios and imagine entertainment to make the suckers out there surrender  9 and 93 minutes of unrecoverable life  
32476,ms ramsay and her cowriter  liana dognini  have dramatized the alan warner novel  which itself felt like an answer to irvine welsh s book trainspotting 
32477,all the sibling rivalry and 
32478,the film acknowledges upfront that the plot makes no sense  such that the lack of linearity is the point of emotional and moral departure for protagonist alice 
32479,his oppressive  rightwing  proprietyobsessed family 
32480,is ultimately what makes shanghai ghetto move beyond a good  dry  reliable textbook and what allows it to rank with its worthy predecessors 
32481,you might be wishing for a watch that makes time go faster rather than the other way around  
32482,sends you away a believer again and quite cheered at just that 
32483,moving  and adventurous directorial debut 
32484,engages us in constant fits of laughter  until we find ourselves surprised at how much we care about the story  and end up walking out not only satisfied but also somewhat touched  
32485,the typical hollywood disregard for historical truth and realism 
32486,the most compelling performance 
32487,dangerous and domineering 
32488,too bad the film s story does not live up to its style

32496,are put to perfect use in the breathtakingly beautiful outerspace documentary space station 3d  
32497,a remake by the numbers  linking a halfwit plot to a series of standup routines in which wilson and murphy show how funny they could have been in a more ambitious movie 
32498,it s a shame that the storyline and its underlying themes  finally seem so impersonal or even shallow  
32499,a spiritual aspect 
32500,an imponderably stilted and selfconsciously arty movie 
32501,try as you might to scrutinize the ethics of kaufman s approach  somehow it all comes together to create a very compelling  sensitive  intelligent and almost cohesive piece of film entertainment  
32502,spare but quietly effective retelling  
32503,both large  and small  with considerable aplomb 
32504,one fantastic visual trope

32616,has the right stuff for silly summer entertainment 
32617,like the rugrats movies  the wild thornberrys movie does nt offer much more than the series  but its emphasis on caring for animals and respecting other cultures is particularly welcome 
32618,far too polite to scale the lunatic heights of joe dante s similarly styled gremlins 
32619,must struggle with the fact that they re playing characters who sometimes feel more like literary conceits than fleshandblood humans 
32620,a movie of technical skill and rare depth of intellect and feeling

32643,the cute frissons of discovery and humor between chaplin and kidman 
32644,moves in such odd plot directions and descends into such messagemongering moralism that its good qualities are obscured

32700,the only problem 
32701,quite enough of them

32754,can tell what it is supposed to be  but ca nt really call it a work of art 
32755,is inspiring  ironic  and revelatory of just how ridiculous and moneyoriented the record industry really is  
32756,all the spaces in between filled with fantasies  daydreams  memories and one fantastic visual trope after another 
32757,rousing  
32758,stay for the credits and see a devastating comic impersonation by dustin hoffman that is revelatory 
32759,even in the summertime  the most restless young audience deserves the dignity of an action hero motivated by something more than franchise possibilities  
32760,for children 
32761,very predictable 
32762,bad rock concert

32815,this is one baaaaaaaaad movie  
32816,but no sense of pride or shame 
32817,like their characters 
32818,illuminating an era of theatrical comedy that  while past  
32819,unsentimental 
32820,elegant  witty and beneath a prim exterior 
32821,an original and highly cerebral examination of the psychopathic mind 
32822,even when there are lulls  the emotions seem authentic  and the picture is so lovely toward the end  you almost do nt notice the 129minute running time 
32823,is a tribute 
32824,comes far closer than many movies to expressing the way many of us live  someplace between consuming selfabsorption and insistently demanding otherness 
32825,the irony is that this film s cast is uniformly superb 
32826,like the rugrats movies  the wild thornberrys movie does nt offer much more than the series  but its emphasis on caring for animals and respecting other cultures is particularly welcome  
32827,it s a lovely  sad dance highlighted by kwan s unique directing style  
32828,campanella s competent direction 
32829,sparkling 
32830,for its sheer audacity and openness 
32831,farce and bloodcurdling family intensity 
32832,that s barely shocking  barely interesting and most of all  barely anything 
32833,restrained and 
32834,entertaining british hybrid 
32835,coal is nt as easy to come by as it used to be and this would be a worthy substitute for naughty children s stockings 
32836,the necessary selfcontrol to guide a loose  poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy 
32837,a hoot 
32838,something has been lost in the translation  another routine hollywood frightfest in which the slack execution italicizes the absurdity of the premise  
32839,to dumb down the universe 
32840,no quarter to anyone seeking to pull a cohesive story out 
32841,a goodnatured ensemble comedy that tries hard to make the most of a bumper 
32842,the very definition of what critics have come to term an  ambitious failure 
32843,shameful 
32844,too narrow to attract crossover viewers 
32845,inspiring 
32846,disastrous 
32847,relies less on forced air than on petter næss  delicate  clever direction  and a wonderful  imaginative script by axel hellstenius 
32848,the animation and game phenomenon 
32849,jacobi  the most fluent of actors  is given relatively dry material from nijinsky s writings to perform  
32850,backwater 
32851,it s a funny little movie with clever dialogue and likeable characters  
32852,an expiration date passed a long time ago 
32853,sexy  surprising romance 
32854,enjoyed themselves 
32855,everyone thinks poopoo jokes are  edgy 
32856,may leave you rolling your eyes in the dark 
32857,they might try paying less attention to the miniseries and more attention to the film it is about  
32858,this film is too busy hitting all of its assigned marks to take on any life of its own  
32859,with an unflappable air of decadent urbanity 
32860,in other words  about as bad a film 
32861,a completely honest  openhearted film that should appeal to anyone willing to succumb to it 
32862,s just tediously bad 
32863,brooding and slow 
32864,graphically illustrates the problems of fledgling democracies  but also the strength and sense of freedom the iranian people already possess  with or without access to the ballot box  
32865,the most depressing moviegoing experiences i can think of 
32866,emotionally satisfying 
32867,rustedout 
32868,have nothing better to do with 94 minutes 
32869,that washington most certainly has a new career ahead of him 
32870,than a spy thriller like the bourne identity 
32871,about kicking undead  
32872,sandler is losing his touch 
32873,build a feelgood fantasy 
32874,who does nt think about percentages all day long 
32875,generally smart casting 
32876,fails to keep it up and 
32877,stillborn except as a harsh conceptual exercise 
32878,just another teen movie 
32879,that turns me into that annoying specimen of humanity that i usually dread encountering the most 
32880,lovely 
32881,did they not 
32882,is hilariously  gloriously alive  and quite often hotter 
32883,is so bleak that it s hardly watchable 
32884,s hard to understand why anyone in his right mind would even think to make the attraction a movie 
32885,was so endlessly  grotesquely  
32886,that by movie s end  we accept the characters and the film  flaws and all 
32887,while illuminating an era of theatrical comedy that  while past  
32888,yet another iteration of what s become one of the movies  creepiest conventions  in which the developmentally disabled are portrayed with almost supernatural powers to humble  teach and ultimately redeem their mentally  superior  friends  family  
32889,not  difficult and sad 
32890,curves 
32891, puts enough salt into the wounds of the tortured and selfconscious material to make it sting  
32892,is sure to raise audience s spirits and leave them singing long after the credits roll  
32893,made spy kids a surprising winner with both adults and younger audiences 
32894,the heart and 
32895,a dashing and resourceful hero  a lisping  reptilian villain  big fights  big hair  lavish period scenery  and 
32896,lulls you 
32897,it is hard to conceive anyone else in their roles  
32898,weird  wonderful  and not necessarily for kids 
32899,sorrow 
32900,completely creatively stillborn and 
32901,occasionally interesting 
32902,of a very lively dream 
32903,s a fine  focused piece of work that reopens an interesting controversy and never succumbs to sensationalism  
32904,transforms this story about love and culture into a cinematic poem 
32905,it s a bad sign when you re rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects  deaths just so the documentary will be over 
32906,enthusiastically 
32907,give credit to everyone from robinson down to the key grip 
32908,some effecting moments 
32909,a deft  delightful mix of sulky teen drama and overcomingobstacles sportsmovie triumph  
32910,on his way to becoming the american indian spike lee 
32911,then pay your  8 and get ready for the big shear  
32912,adding the rich details and 
32913,affirm love s power to help people endure almost unimaginable horror 
32914,caddyshack 
32915,is little question that this is a serious work by an important director who has something new to say about how  in the flipflop of courtship  we often reel in when we should be playing out 
32916,it does nt offer any insights that have nt been thoroughly debated in the media already  back in the dahmer heyday of the mid  90s 
32917,too bad kramer 
32918,it s quite diverting nonsense  
32919,laugh therapy  
32920,goes to absurd lengths to duck the very issues it raises  
32921,with a romantic comedy plotline straight from the ages 
32922,a bizarre piece of work  with premise and dialogue at the level of kids  television and plot threads 
32923,of the glum  numb experience of watching o fantasma 
32924,independence  complete with loads of cgi and bushels of violence  but not a drop of human blood 
32925,that led to their notorious rise to infamy 
32926,lustrous 
32927, intimate and intelligent 
32928,it s all bluster and cliché 
32929,is so thoughtlessly assembled 
32930,statements and dimestore ruminations 
32931,repugnant 
32932,the dramatic scenes are frequently unintentionally funny  and the action sequences  clearly the main event  are surprisingly uninvolving  
32933,hollow  selfindulgent  
32934,a degree of affection rather than 
32935,weird amalgam 
32936,greatest hits 
32937,it is most remarkable not because of its epic scope  but because of the startling intimacy it achieves despite that breadth  
32938,a dull  simpleminded and stereotypical tale of drugs  death and mindnumbing indifference on the innercity streets 
32939,definitely worth 95 minutes of your time 
32940,savagely hilarious 
32941,valiantly struggled to remain interested  or at least conscious 
32942,not one clever line 
32943,privileged moments and 
32944,clever and funny 
32945,to recite bland police procedural details  fiennes wanders around in an attempt 
32946,so unabashedly hopeful that it actually makes the heart soar 
32947,is at 22 a powerful young actor 
32948,undermining the movie s reality and 
32949,comedically labored 
32950,a caricature  not even with that radioactive hair 
32951,nearly three decades of bittersweet camaraderie and history 
32952,the masses with star power  a popinduced score 
32953,letdown 
32954,the woodman seems to have directly influenced this girlmeetsgirl love story  but even more reassuring is how its makers actually seem to understand what made allen s romantic comedies so pertinent and enduring  
32955,is all over the place  really  
32956,well worth 
32957,one film that s truly deserving of its oscar nomination 
32958,just the sort of lazy tearjerker that gives movies about ordinary folk a bad name  
32959,wiggling energy 
32960,bloodwork is nt a terrible movie  just a stultifyingly obvious one  an unrewarding collar for a murder mystery  
32961,superb performances throughout 
32962,scorsese s bold images and generally smart casting ensure that  gangs  is never lethargic 
32963,a worthwhile glimpse 
32964,is clever and funny  
32965,a fairly enjoyable mixture 
32966,takes a surprising  subtle turn at the midway point 
32967,unspeakably  unbearably dull 
32968,is less concerned with cultural and political issues than doting on its eccentric characters  
32969,quite simply  a joy to watch and  especially  to listen to 
32970,be madcap farce 
32971,most edgy 
32972,an empty exercise  a florid but ultimately vapid crime melodrama with lots of surface flash but little emotional resonance  
32973,that is often quite rich and exciting 
32974,jackass 
32975,of being the big 
32976,pompous and garbled  
32977,oftentimes funny  yet ultimately cowardly 
32978,were a series of bible parables and not an actual story 
32979,david letterman and the onion 
32980,its recent predecessor miserably 
32981,the expectation of laughter has been quashed by whatever obscenity is at hand 
32982,to the otherwise bleak tale 
32983,spiritcrushing 
32984,it sounds like another clever if pointless excursion into the abyss  and 
32985,should please history fans 
32986,the cast is appealing 
32987,s awfully entertaining to watch 
32988,as katzenberg 
32989,be invented to describe exactly how bad it is 
32990,little action  almost no suspense or believable tension  onedimensional characters up the wazoo and sets that can only be described as scifi generic  
32991,the transporter bombards the viewer with so many explosions and side snap kicks that it ends up being surprisingly dull 
32992,a more measured or polished production 
32993,worthy addition 
32994,deep into the girls  confusion and pain as they struggle tragically to comprehend the chasm of knowledge that s opened between them 
32995,not only a comingofage story and cautionary parable  but also a perfectly rendered period piece 
32996,can be made 
32997,the engagingly primitive animated special effects contribute to a mood that s sustained through the surprisingly somber conclusion  
32998,a powerful and deeply moving example 
32999,of a mushy  existential exploration of why men leave their families 
33000,affirming and heartbreaking 
33001,crossingover 
33002,a surprisingly charming and even witty match for the best of hollywood s comicbook adaptations  
33003,thud 
33004,the plot  surprises 
33005, selfindulgent and maddening 
33006,this is a mormon family movie  and a sappy  preachy one at that 
33007,spellbinding fun 
33008,make the stones weep 
33009,flatout amusing  
33010,astonishing   frames  profound ethical and philosophical questions in the form of dazzling pop entertainment  
33011,from this threehour endurance test built around an hour s worth of actual material 
33012,feels especially thin stretched over the nearly 80minute running time 
33013,d live in if argento s hollywood counterparts  had this much imagination and nerve 
33014,expected flair 
33015,to his son s home 
33016,itself is far from disappointing  offering an original 
33017,s like going to a house party and watching the host defend himself against a frothing exgirlfriend  
33018,talented  charismatic and tragically 
33019,can be viewed as pure composition and form  film as music 
33020,would recommend big bad love only to winger fans who have missed her since 1995 s forget paris 
33021,is for the most part a useless movie  even with a great director at the helm  
33022,dramatically forceful 
33023,content merely to lionize its title character and exploit his anger  
33024,its heart 
33025,exceedingly clever 
33026,he delivers fascinating psychological fare 
33027,the  wow  factor 
33028,need nt be steeped in 50s sociology  pop culture or movie lore to appreciate the emotional depth of haynes  work  
33029,feels uncomfortably real  its language and locations bearing the unmistakable stamp of authority

33038, that would be me  fighting off the urge to doze  
33039,undercut by its awkward structure and a final veering toward melodrama  
33040,just might go down as one of the alltime great apocalypse movies  
33041,gets caught up in the rush of slapstick thoroughfare  
33042,the worst kind of filmmaking  the kind that pretends to be passionate and truthful but is really frustratingly timid and soggy 
33043,more sophisticated and literate than such pictures usually are 
33044,completely creatively stillborn and executed in a manner that i m not sure 
33045,a fast paced and suspenseful argentinian thriller about the shadow side 
33046,fessenden continues to do interesting work  and it would be nice to see what he could make with a decent budget  
33047,keen eye  sweet spirit 
33048,gets the details right  from its promenade of barely clad bodies in myrtle beach  sc  to the adrenaline jolt of a sudden lunch rush at the diner  
33049,an overall sense of brusqueness 
33050,with honesty that is tragically rare in the depiction of young women in film 
33051,rifkin no doubt fancies himself something of a hubert selby jr  but there is nt an ounce of honest poetry in his entire script  
33052,rifkin no doubt fancies himself something of a hubert selby jr  but there is nt an ounce of honest poetry in his entire script  it s simply crude and unrelentingly exploitative 
33053,it has fun with the quirks of family life 
33054,though it s not very well shot or composed or edited  the score is too insistent and 
33055,do nt even like their characters  
33056,suspenseful enough for older kids but 
33057,fascinating experiment 
33058,sleek and arty 
33059,most alive 
33060,probing or penetrating 
33061,as the man who bilked unsuspecting moviegoers 
33062,the wild wild west 
33063,seem like mere splashing around in the muck 
33064,whether or not ram dass proves as clear and reliable an authority on that as he was about inner consciousness  fierce grace reassures us that he will once again be an honest and loving one  
33065,do nt think most of the people who loved the 1989 paradiso will prefer this new version  
33066,found the ring moderately absorbing  largely for its elegantly colorful look and sound 
33067,bittersweet 
33068,silly  and gross  but it s rarely as moronic as some campus grossout films  
33069,viscerally repellent

33076,your brain and your secret agent decoder ring at the door 
33077,it s refreshing that someone understands the need for the bad boy

34414,about 25 minutes of decent material 
34415,for devotees of french cinema 
34416,we never feel anything for these characters  and as a result the film is basically just a curiosity  
34417,predictable outcome 
34418,borrows a bit from the classics  wait until dark  and  extremities   but in terms of its style  the movie is in a class by itself

34447,generate a lot of energy 
34448,perfectly pitched between comedy and tragedy  hope and despair  about schmidt instead comes far closer than many movies to expressing the way many of us live  someplace between consuming selfabsorption and insistently demanding otherness

34519,i ca nt begin to tell you how tedious  how resolutely unamusing  how thoroughly unrewarding all of this is  and what a reckless squandering of four fine acting talents  
34520,find it with ring  an indisputably spooky film  
34521,comes along only occasionally  one so unconventional  
34522,can truly be

34540,gets the tone just right  funny in the middle of sad in the middle of hopeful 
34541,they have been patiently waiting for 
34542, the film never recovers from the clumsy cliché of the ugly american abroad  and the toofrosty exterior ms paltrow employs to authenticate her british persona is another liability  
34543,a story whose restatement is validated by the changing composition of the nation 
34544,to boring  selfimportant stories of how horrible we are to ourselves and each other 
34545,adding flourishes  artsy fantasy sequences  that simply feel wrong 
34546,aching 
34547,teardrenched 
34548,often shocking but ultimately worthwhile 
34549,most thrillers send audiences out talking about specific scary scenes or startling moments   frailty  leaves us with the terrifying message that the real horror may be waiting for us at home  
34550,this remake of lina wertmuller s 1975 eroticomedy might just be the biggest husbandandwife disaster since john and bo derek made the ridiculous bolero

34560,steals the show without resorting to camp as nicholas  wounded and wounding uncle ralph  
34561,nearly every attempt at humor here is doa  
34562,ditched the saccharine sentimentality of bicentennial man in favor of an altogether darker side 
34563,rosenthal  halloween ii  
34564,is a movie that will stimulate hours of post viewing discussion  if only to be reminded of who did what to whom and why 
34565,what should have been a painless timekiller 
34566,stirring road movie  
34567,rather brilliant little cult item 
34568,from any cinematic razzledazzle but from its recovery of an historical episode that  in the simple telling  proves simultaneously harrowing and uplifting 
34569,is just such an achievement  
34570,resonant 
34571,is neither dramatic nor comic 
34572,in heaven 
34573,albeit a visually compelling one  
34574,all the story gives us is flashing red lights  a rattling noise  and a bump on the head 
34575,the most original in years 
34576,comes to resemble the kind of softcore twaddle you d expect to see on showtime s  red shoe diaries  
34577,should bolster director and cowriter 
34578,few  cool  actors 
34579,i must have failed 
34580,is even lazier and far less enjoyable 
34581,a cheap  ludicrous attempt at serious horror 
34582, the film ascends to a kinetic life so teeming that even cranky adults may rediscover the quivering kid inside  
34583, doing its namesake proud 
34584,been a lighthearted comedy 
34585,been any easier to sit through than this hastily dubbed disaster 
34586,seems to be missing a great deal of the acerbic repartee of the play  
34587,distracted 
34588,for the fine star performances 
34589,enigmatic features 
34590,is more fun than conan the barbarian 
34591,both the scenic splendor of the mountains

34593,halfbaked 
34594,irresponsible sandlerian 
34595,have been perfect for an old  twilight zone  episode 
34596,does nt have anything really interesting to say  
34597,this is a movie full of grace 
34598,rip off that we were aware of 
34599,seems to have in mind an  emotionally at least  adolescent audience demanding regular shocks and bouts of barely defensible sexual violence to keep it interested 
34600,smacks of exhibitionism 
34601,the flash of rock videos fused with solid performances and eerie atmosphere  
34602,big mistake  
34603,re not likely to have seen before  but beneath the exotic surface  and exotic dancing  it s surprisingly oldfashioned  
34604,packed with subplots involving the various silbersteins that it feels more like the pilot episode of a tv series than a feature film 
34605,under a rock 
34606,make an alluring backdrop for this sensuous and spirited tale of a prim widow who finds an unlikely release in bellydancing clubs  
34607,overlong 
34608, pays tribute to heroes the way julia roberts hands out awards  with phony humility barely camouflaging grotesque narcissism  
34609, this is a film that takes a stand in favor of tradition and warmth  
34610,is no solace here  no entertainment value  merely a fierce lesson in where filmmaking can take us 
34611,behind the project 
34612,the capable cast 
34613,passion  and genius 
34614,deliver again and again 
34615,one whose lessons are well worth revisiting as many times as possible 
34616,to protect your community from the dullest science fiction 
34617,the emotion or timelessness of disney s great past  or 
34618, loud  bangthedrum 
34619,it establishes its ominous mood and tension swiftly  and if the suspense never rises to a higher level  it is nevertheless maintained throughout  
34620,that is funny  touching  smart and complicated 
34621,cinematography and exhilarating pointofview shots and fewer slowmotion  grandeur  shots 
34622,cinderella 
34623,do nt mind crappy movies as much as adults  provided there s lots of cute animals and clumsy people  
34624, spiteful idiots 
34625, the best disney movie since the lion king  
34626,a script  by paul pender  made of wood 
34627,not all that bad of a movie 
34628,a bomb 
34629,a wild ride with eight boarders from venice beach that was a deserved cowinner of the audience award for documentaries at the sundance film festival  
34630,that woman s doubts 
34631,is wickedly fun 
34632,the part where nothing s happening  or the part where something s happening 
34633,but this new jangle of noise  mayhem and stupidity must be a serious contender for the title  
34634,repeated 
34635,taken the protagonists a full hour 
34636,smartly written motion picture 
34637,distinguished and thoughtful 
34638,chaiken ably balances realtime rhythms with propulsive incident  
34639,it s a loathsome movie  it really is and 
34640,makes little attempt to give voice to the other side 
34641,a web of dazzling entertainment 
34642,ll love it and probably want to see it twice 
34643,which director shekhar kapur supplies with tremendous skill 
34644,to be a bit of a cheat in the end 
34645,more traditionally plotted popcorn thriller 
34646,celebrates universal human nature 
34647,while dark water is nt a complete wash  no pun intended   watched sidebyside with ringu  it ultimately comes off as a pale successor  
34648,that proceeds from a stunningly unoriginal premise 
34649,makes the grade as tawdry trash 
34650,that s good enough  
34651, a great  participatory spectator sport   
34652,tug at your heart in ways that utterly transcend gender 
34653,hiphop prison thriller of stupefying absurdity 
34654,felt like to be a new yorker  or  really  to be a human being  in the weeks after 911 
34655,most savagely hilarious social critics 
34656,emotionally malleable 
34657,are missing  anything approaching a visceral kick  and anything approaching even a vague reason to sit through it all  
34658,s really unclear 
34659,agreeably 
34660,sordid of human behavior on the screen 
34661,too bad to be good 
34662,a disappointingly thin slice of lowerclass london life  despite the title  amounts to surprisingly little 
34663,looked like crap  
34664,attractive men 
34665,s a roadtrip drama with too many wrong turns 
34666,bears out as your typical junkie opera 
34667,layer of action man cliché atop wooden dialogue and a shifting tone that falls far short of the peculiarly moral amorality of  woo s  best work 
34668,like a tired tyco ad 
34669,a oneofakind tour de force 
34670,deftly manages to avoid many of the condescending stereotypes that so often plague films dealing with the mentally ill 
34671,a terrific date movie  whatever your orientation  
34672,bears a grievous but obscure complaint against fathers  and circles it obsessively  without making contact 
34673,the courage of its convictions and 
34674,has its heart  and its palate  
34675,unsatisfied 
34676, but to his legend 
34677,as lively an account as seinfeld is deadpan  
34678,s certainly laudable that the movie deals with hotbutton issues in a comedic context 
34679,a kiss 
34680,can almost see mendes and company getting together before a single frame had been shot and collectively vowing   this is going to be something really good  
34681,deadon in election 
34682,and  
34683,unusually dryeyed  even analytical approach 
34684,has all the hallmarks of a movie designed strictly for children s home video  a market so insatiable it absorbs all manner of lame entertainment  as long as 3yearolds find it diverting  
34685,knows it s won 
34686,hollywood has crafted a solid formula for successful animated movies  
34687,to remain an unchanged dullard 
34688,vulgarity 
34689,rabbitproof fence is a quest story as grand as the lord of the rings 
34690, the film is doing something of a public service  shedding light on a group of extremely talented musicians who might otherwise go unnoticed and underappreciated by music fans  
34691,compelling yarn 
34692,humorous and heartfelt  
34693,a rather brilliant little cult item  
34694,potentially just as rewarding 
34695,energetic and always surprising 
34696,overuse 
34697,never come up with an adequate reason why we should pay money for what we can get on television for free 
34698,make for great cinema 
34699,ll still have a good time 
34700,of flatly 
34701,pulse 
34702,makes a nice album 
34703,strong piece of work 
34704,your 20th outing shows off a lot of stamina and vitality  and get this 
34705,attempts  in vain  to prove that moviestar intensity can overcome bad hair design 
34706,a sweettempered comedy that forgoes the kneejerk misogyny that passes for humor in so many teenage comedies 
34707,a lackluster script and substandard performances 
34708,suffers because of its many excesses 
34709,badly interlocked stories drowned by all too clever complexity  
34710,garbage  
34711,is funny and looks professional  
34712,socalled satire 
34713,there s no conversion effort  much of the writing is genuinely witty and both stars are appealing enough to probably have a good shot at a hollywood career  if they want one 
34714,tearjerking 
34715,are faithful to melville s plotline  they 
34716,a strong and confident work which works so well for the first 89 minutes  but ends so horrendously confusing in the final two 
34717,one of those decadesspanning historical epics that strives to be intimate and socially encompassing but fails to do justice to either effort in three hours of screen time  
34718,definitely funny stuff  but it s more of the  laughing at  variety than the  laughing with 
34719,fuss or noise 
34720,s not really funny 
34721,at once overly oldfashioned in its sudsy plotting and 
34722,the best thing 
34723,many definitions of  time waster  
34724,five screenwriters are credited with the clichéladen screenplay  it seems as if each watered down the version of the one before

34727,fascination 
34728,fumbles the vital action sequences 
34729,easy  seductive 
34730,like me  think an action film disguised as a war tribute is disgusting to begin with 
34731,may also be the best sex comedy about environmental pollution ever made 
34732,at the absurdities and inconsistencies 
34733,the  soontobeforgettable  section of the quirky ripoff prison 
34734,into its intriguing subject 
34735,all bluster and cliché 
34736,his personal obstacles 
34737,s still unusually crafty and intelligent for hollywood horror  
34738,both refreshingly different 
34739,a wild ride of a movie that keeps throwing fastballs  
34740,insults 
34741,excellent performances 
34742,nothing more than an amiable but unfocused bagatelle that plays like a looselyconnected string of actingworkshop exercises 
34743, the film works  mostly due to its superior cast of characters  
34744,like a cruel deception carried out by men of marginal intelligence  with reactionary ideas about women and a total lack of empathy 
34745,above the globe in dazzling panoramic shots that make the most of the largescreen format  before swooping down on a string of exotic locales  scooping the whole world up in a joyous communal festival of rhythm 
34746,the filmmakers look down on their workingclass subjects from their lofty perch  that finally makes sex with strangers  which opens today in the new york metropolitan area  so distasteful 
34747,loneliness and desperate grandiosity 
34748,his sweetness and vulnerability 
34749,will be upstaged by an avalanche of more appealing holidayseason product 
34750,the percussion rhythm  the brass soul and the sense of fierce competition that helps make great marching bands half the fun of college football games 
34751,is a gritty police thriller with all the dysfunctional family dynamics one could wish for  
34752,remarkable new trick 
34753,most multilayered and sympathetic female characters 
34754,been worth caring about 
34755,s still terrible

34757,by turns very dark and very funny  
34758,never fails him 
34759,a few zingers aside  the writing is indifferent  and jordan brady s direction is prosaic  
34760,stylish and moody 
34761,episode ii  
34762,begins as a seven ripoff  
34763,a cross between blow and boyz n the hood  this movie strives to be more  but does nt quite get there  
34764,a familyoriented nondisney film that is actually funny without hitting below the belt 
34765,documentary to make the stones weep  as shameful as it 
34766,even if the enticing prospect of a lot of nubile young actors in a film about campus depravity did nt fade amid the deliberate  tiresome ugliness 
34767,produce adequate performances 
34768,trailertrash 
34769,to a problem hollywood too long has ignored 
34770,you get the impression that writer and director burr steers knows the territory  but his sense of humor has yet to lose the smug selfsatisfaction usually associated with the better private schools  
34771,uses the last act to reel in the audience since its poignancy hooks us completely 
34772,pandering 
34773,love a disney pic 
34774,worthwhile environmental message 
34775,of those decadesspanning historical epics that strives to be intimate and socially encompassing but fails to do justice to either effort in three hours of screen time 
34776,is one of the bestsustained ideas i have ever seen on the screen 
34777,it s a tribute to the actress  and to her inventive director  that the journey is such a mesmerizing one 
34778,a beautiful  timeless and universal tale of heated passions  jealousy  betrayal  forgiveness and murder  
34779,nimble shoulders 
34780,by its awkward structure and a final veering

34782,stage director sam mendes showcases tom hanks as a depression era hitman in this dark tale of revenge  
34783,much a home video  and so devoid of artifice and purpose that it appears not to have been edited at all

34836,by the end you ca nt help but feel  stoked   
34837,vainly 
34838,a florid but ultimately vapid crime melodrama with lots of surface

34868,there are many tense scenes in trapped 
34869,is dark  brooding and slow  and takes its central idea way too seriously 
34870,big excuse 
34871,the screenplay is hugely overwritten  with tons and tons of dialogue  most of it given to children

34895,piece  a model of menacing atmosphere  
34896,enough may pander to our basest desires for payback  but unlike many revenge fantasies  it ultimately delivers  
34897,the film s midtolow budget 
34898,do nt mind crappy movies as much as adults  provided there s lots of cute animals and clumsy people 
34899,the most goodhearted yet sensual entertainment 
34900,is way too indulgent  
34901,wonderful but sometimes confusing flashback 
34902,and mordantly humorous

34904,can make people act weird 
34905,been done before but never so vividly or with so much passion 
34906,be much funnier than anything in the film 
34907,it s more enjoyable than i expected  though  and that s because the laughs come from fairly basic comedic constructs 
34908,after an hour and a half of wondering  sometimes amusedly  sometimes impatiently  just what this strenuously unconventional movie is supposed to be 
34909,s a tribute to the actress  and to her inventive director  that the journey is such a mesmerizing one 
34910,the vital comic ingredient of the hilarious writerdirector himself 
34911, and excellent use of music by india s popular gulzar and jagjit singh

34924,unexpectedly moving 
34925,most genuinely sweet 
34926,never found its audience  probably because it s extremely hard to relate to any of the characters  
34927,the sum of all fears pretends to be a serious exploration of nuclear terrorism  but 
34928,rendered with such clarity 
34929,acting  but ultimately a movie with no reason for being

34980,that both thrills the eye and  in its overthetop way  touches the heart 
34981,its exquisite acting  inventive screenplay 
34982,can just follow the same blueprint from hundreds of other films  sell it to the highest bidder and walk away without anyone truly knowing your identity

35062,as plain and pedestrian as 
35063,like a comedian who starts off promisingly but then proceeds to flop 
35064,at once laughable and compulsively watchable

35071,as you would expect from the directors of the little mermaid and aladdin 
35072,that satisfies  as comfort food often can

35091,properly spooky 
35092,one problem with the movie  directed by joel schumacher  is that it jams too many prefabricated story elements into the running time  
35093,has none of the pushiness and decibel volume of most contemporary comedies 
35094,to do all three quite well  making it one of the year s most enjoyable releases 
35095,will have a showdown 
35096, the drama feels rigged and sluggish  
35097,whimsicality 
35098,is so resolutely cobbled together out of older movies that it even uses a totally unnecessary prologue  just because it seems obligatory  
35099,an excellent companion piece 
35100,very much a home video  and so devoid of artifice and purpose that it appears not to have been edited at all

35103,observations on the human condition 
35104,stands out from the pack even if the picture itself is somewhat problematic  
35105,underrehearsed

35121,most multilayered and sympathetic 
35122,family comedy 
35123,is a failure 
35124,the script and characters hold sway 
35125,is ultimately quite unengaging 
35126,is significantly less charming than listening to a fouryearold with a taste for exaggeration recount his halloween trip to the haunted house  
35127,that recalls the classics of early italian neorealism 
35128,that it does nt give a damn

35146,the worst of tragedies 
35147,incredibly captivating 
35148,s often overwritten  with a surfeit of weighty revelations  flowery dialogue  and nostalgia for the past and roads not taken

35175,what s needed so badly but what is virtually absent here is either a saving dark humor or the feel of poetic tragedy

35981, soderbergh  tends to place most of the psychological and philosophical material in italics rather than trust an audience s intelligence  and he creates an overall sense of brusqueness 
35982,makes it a comic book with soul 
35983,it accurately reflects the rage and alienation that fuels the selfdestructiveness of many young people

35992,piffle 
35993,freshly 
35994,there is a difference between movies with the courage to go over the top and movies that do nt care about being stupid 
35995,dreary piece 
35996,of magic 
35997,birthday girl does nt try to surprise us with plot twists  but rather seems to enjoy its own transparency  
35998,entirely witless and 
35999,erotically 
36000,unpleasant excuse 
36001,a mustsee for fans of thoughtful war films and those interested in the sights and sounds of battle  
36002,could be  by its art and heart  a necessary one  
36003,it wo nt hold up over the long haul  but in the moment  finch s tale provides the forgettable pleasures of a saturday matinee  
36004,has hugely imaginative and successful casting to its great credit  as well as one terrific score and attitude to spare  
36005, even if you ve never heard of chaplin  you ll still be glued to the screen  
36006,is so rich with period minutiae it s like dying and going to celluloid heaven

36017,a tightly directed  highly professional film that s oldfashioned in all the best possible ways  
36018,go down as one of the alltime great apocalypse movies 
36019,makes a feature debut that is fully formed and remarkably assured  
36020,all the trappings of an energetic  extremesports adventure 
36021,any rock pile will do for a set  
36022,too shallow for an older one  
36023,have stayed there 
36024,is a story that zings all the way through with originality  humor and pathos  
36025,lacks the skill or presence to regain any ground 
36026,any stylish sizzle 
36027,is a director to watch 
36028,with a cast of alist brit actors  it is worth searching out  
36029,even in terms of the lowgrade cheese standards on which it operates  it never quite makes the grade as tawdry trash  
36030,precision 
36031,the filmmakers just follow the books 
36032,a wholly unnecessary precredit sequence 
36033,loveable 
36034,you can feel the love

36041,slick and 
36042,robinson s web of suspense matches the pageturning frenzy that clancy creates  
36043,begins as a conventional thriller evolves into a gorgeously atmospheric meditation on lifechanging chance encounters 
36044,is the stuff that disney movies are made of 
36045,bears  should keep parents amused with its low groantoguffaw ratio 
36046,all looks and plays like a  40 million version of a game you re more likely to enjoy on a computer  
36047,that i just did nt care 
36048,even when there are lulls  the emotions seem authentic  
36049,is the stuff of high romance  brought off with considerable wit  
36050,lush 
36051,familial 
36052,absorbing and unsettling psychological drama 
36053,this 10th film in the series looks and feels tired  
36054,comes across as a relic from a bygone era  and its convolutions  feel silly rather than plausible 
36055, alone  should scare any sane person away  
36056,a touching drama about old age and grief with a tour de force performance by michel piccoli  
36057,look at the starmaking machinery of tinseltown  
36058,a masterfully made one 
36059,preposterous  the movie will likely set the cause of woman warriors back decades

36074,aggravating and 
36075,stops being clever and devolves into flashy  vaguely silly overkill 
36076,unwieldy contraption

36094,todd solondz  oftentimes funny  yet ultimately cowardly autocritique 
36095,to indulge the fanciful daydreams of janice beard  eileen walsh  when her reallife persona is so charmless and vacant 
36096,we keep getting torn away from the compelling historical tale to a lesscompelling soap opera

36109,the astonishingly pivotal role of imagination in the soulful development of two rowdy teenagers 
36110,liotta is put in an impossible spot because his character s deceptions ultimately undo him and the believability of the entire scenario

36118,a sad  sordid universe 
36119,bitchy frolic which pokes fun at the price of popularity and smalltown pretension in the lone star state 
36120,is a stunning new young talent in one of chabrol s most intense psychological mysteries 
36121,is like sitting in a downtown café  overhearing a bunch of typical latetwentysomethings natter on about nothing  and desperately wishing you could change tables

36131,that affirms the nourishing aspects of love and companionship 
36132,takes your breath away 
36133,unsettling psychodrama that takes full  chilling advantage of its rougharoundtheedges  lowbudget constraints

36137,a tasty performance from vincent gallo 
36138,commands attention  
36139,off spookily enough 
36140,could have been crisper and punchier  but it s likely to please audiences who like movies that demand four hankies  
36141,overwhelmed by its lack of purpose 
36142,enjoy a couple of great actors hamming it up 
36143,a tremendous  offbeat sense of style and humor that suggests he was influenced by some of the filmmakers who have directed him  especially the coen brothers and steven soderbergh 
36144,again  in a better movie  you might not have noticed  
36145,americans 
36146,s a rather listless amble down 
36147,it sounds like another clever if pointless excursion into the abyss  and that s more or less how it plays out 
36148,what it lacks in outright newness 
36149,is a sweet treasure and something well worth 
36150, frailty  offers chills much like those that you get when sitting around a campfire around midnight  telling creepy stories to give each other the willies  
36151,eight legged freaks is clever and funny  is amused by its special effects  and leaves you feeling like you ve seen a movie instead of an endless trailer  
36152,with several survivors  whose riveting memories are rendered with such clarity that it s as if it all happened only yesterday 
36153,far too tragic 
36154,promising cast 
36155,overflows with wisdom and emotion  
36156,a surfeit of weighty revelations  flowery dialogue  and nostalgia for the past 
36157,an elegant film with often surprising twists and an intermingling of naiveté and sophistication  
36158,the plot is paperthin and the characters are nt interesting enough to watch them go about their daily activities for two whole hours 
36159,helljaunt purists 
36160,expressive power 
36161,did they deem it necessary to document all this emotional misery 
36162,it gives poor dana carvey nothing to do that is really funny  and then expects us to laugh because he acts so goofy all the time 
36163,manages to breathe life into this somewhat tired premise  
36164,fessenden continues to do interesting work  and it would be nice to see what he could make with a decent budget 
36165,glaring and unforgettable  
36166,the benefit of being able to give full performances 
36167,being insightful 
36168,before it builds up to its insanely staged ballroom scene  in which 3000 actors appear in full regalia 
36169,is that  even in all its director s cut glory  he s made a film that s barely shocking  barely interesting and most of all  barely anything  
36170,s like a driveby

36176,simply feel wrong

36181,feel free to go get popcorn whenever he s not onscreen  
36182,involved  starting with spielberg and going right through the ranks of the players  oncamera and off  that he brings together  
36183,a 1986 harlem that does nt look much like anywhere in new york 
36184,visual flourishes

36198,for unexpectedly giddy viewing 
36199,summer season

36207,makes their project so interesting 
36208,moralizing 
36209,spectacular completion one 
36210,at once visceral and spiritual  wonderfully vulgar and sublimely lofty  and as emotionally grand 
36211,if it had been only halfanhour long or a tv special  the humor would have been fast and furious  at ninety minutes  it drags  
36212,an adventure story and history lesson 
36213,to soothe and break your heart with a single stroke 
36214,a plethora of engaging diatribes on the meaning of  home   delivered in grand passion by the members of the various households  
36215, the movie is in a class by itself 
36216,need not apply 
36217,may be disappointed  
36218,a sane regimen of eating  sleeping and stressreducing contemplation 
36219,ignite 
36220,where janice beard falters in its recycled aspects  implausibility  and sags in pace 
36221,absolutely no idea 
36222,was developed hastily after oedekerk 
36223,quite simply  a joy to watch and  especially  to listen to  
36224,than like a bottomfeeder sequel in the escape from new york series 
36225,a teen movie with a humanistic message

36239,esther seems to remain an unchanged dullard 
36240,much panache 
36241,moments to keep it entertaining 
36242,a question comes to mind  so why is this so boring  
36243,is a genuinely bonechilling tale  
36244,messy 
36245,the screenplay flounders under the weight of too many story lines  
36246,find greatness 
36247,too many films that can be as simultaneously funny  offbeat and heartwarming  without a thick shmear of the goo  at least  
36248,to please others 
36249,does nt try to surprise us with plot twists  but rather seems to enjoy its own transparency 
36250,so bland 
36251,consider the film a celluloid litmus test for the intellectual and emotional pedigree of your date and a giant step backward for a director i admire 
36252,is interested in nothing 
36253, quirky  original 
36254,also a  dare i say it twice  delightfully charming  and totally american  
36255,the beauty of the piece is that it counts heart as important as humor  
36256,repellent 
36257,before i see this piece of crap again 
36258,romanek keeps adding flourishes  artsy fantasy sequences  that simply feel wrong  
36259,it s sweet  funny  charming  and completely delightful  
36260,is an intelligent  realistic portrayal of testing boundaries  
36261,an impressive and highly entertaining celebration 
36262,unconditional love and compassion garnered from years of seeing it all  a condition only the old are privy to  and  often misconstrued as weakness 
36263,bombastic and ultimately empty 
36264,ditched the saccharine sentimentality of bicentennial man 
36265,ugly behavior 
36266,possibly the best actor 
36267,a good idea that was followed by the bad idea to turn it into a movie 
36268,just another disjointed  
36269,a great piece of filmmaking 
36270,breathtakingly

36281,it s the butt of its own joke 
36282,exciting 
36283,becalmed 
36284,an amateurish  quasiimprovised acting exercise 
36285,expects something special but 
36286,is silly but strangely believable 
36287,just not a thrilling movie 
36288,aimless  
36289,feel funny and light 
36290, they go to a pictureperfect beach during sunset  
36291, selfhating  selfdestructive ways 
36292,tells this very compelling tale with little fuss or noise  expertly plucking tension from quiet  
36293,is doa 
36294,hip 
36295,exhilarating  funny and fun 
36296,whether jason x is this bad on purpose is never clear  
36297,could have used my two hours better watching being john malkovich again  
36298,you may just end up trying to drown yourself in a lake afterwards  
36299,greengrass 
36300,deserves the dignity of an action hero motivated by something more than franchise possibilities 
36301,robbed and 
36302,following your dream 
36303,it has its faults  but it is a kind  unapologetic  sweetheart of a movie  and mandy moore leaves a positive impression 
36304,the intricate preciseness 
36305,of bland hollywood romance 
36306,not only a comingofage story and cautionary parable  but also a perfectly rendered period piece  
36307,is pleasant  diverting and modest  definitely a step in the right direction 
36308,witless script 
36309,the film gets close to the chimps the same way goodall did  with a serious minded patience  respect and affection  
36310,that carries you along in a torrent of emotion as it explores the awful complications of one terrifying day 
36311,resolutely unamusing  how thoroughly unrewarding all of this is 
36312,beneath the film s obvious determination to shock at any cost lies considerable skill and determination  backed by sheer nerve  
36313,should be thrown back in the river 
36314,suspense  intriguing characters and 
36315,comedy genre 
36316,sabotaged 
36317,on some levels 
36318,a movie theater 
36319,would not improve much after a therapeutic zap of shock treatment  
36320,be remembered as one of  witherspoon s  better films 
36321,the elements were all there but lack of a pyschological center knocks it flat 
36322,highly spirited 
36323,draws its considerable power 
36324,the filmmakers and studio are brazen enough to attempt to pass this stinker off as a scary movie 
36325,selfglorification and 
36326,disguised 
36327,suited to a quiet evening on pbs than a night out at an amc

36330,had a lot of problems with this movie  
36331,galled that you ve wasted nearly two hours of your own precious life with this silly little puddle of a movie 
36332,the most unpleasant things the studio 
36333,too smug 
36334,more than capable 
36335,tackling serious themes

36338,he seems to want both  but succeeds in making neither  
36339,wanes  
36340,is refreshingly undogmatic about its characters  
36341,unless bob crane is someone of particular interest to you  this film s impressive performances and adept direction are nt likely to leave a lasting impression  
36342,i loved the look of this film  
36343,adorably ditsy but heartfelt performances  and 
36344,makes you crave chris smith s next movie 
36345,except it s much 
36346,sterile and 
36347, but it at least calls attention to a problem hollywood too long has ignored  
36348,the movie enters a realm where few nonporn films venture  and comes across as darkly funny  energetic  and surprisingly gentle  
36349,fudged opportunity 
36350,thoughtprovoking picture  
36351,elegant  
36352,ve ever seen before  and yet completely familiar  
36353,an authentically vague  but ultimately purposeless  study 
36354,would nt matter so much that this arrogant richard pryor wannabe s routine is offensive  puerile and unimaginatively foulmouthed if it was at least funny 
36355,this will be on video long before they grow up and you can wait till then  
36356,into how long is this movie  
36357,everything we hold dear about cinema  only now it s begun to split up so that it can do even more damage 
36358,soso slapstick

36369,to give you brain strain 
36370,great trashy fun 
36371,with regret and  ultimately  finding redemption 
36372,its social and political potential 
36373,re going to subjugate truth to the tearjerking demands of soap opera 
36374,dishonest and pat

36768,insulted 
36769,men in black ii achieves ultimate insignificance 
36770,s refreshing that someone understands the need for the bad boy 
36771,it will just as likely make you weep  and it will do so in a way that does nt make you feel like a sucker  
36772,the movie does leave you marveling at these guys  superhuman capacity to withstand pain 
36773,my mind kept returning to one anecdote for comparison  the cartoon in japan that gave people seizures  
36774,swooning melodrama 
36775,stands still in more ways that one in clockstoppers  a scifi thriller as lazy as it is interminable 
36776,make a clear point 
36777,fertile 
36778,energetic and sweetly whimsical 
36779,but nononsense human beings they are and for the stillinestimable contribution they have made to our shared history 
36780,playful but highly studied and 
36781,it s a crime movie made by someone who obviously knows nothing about crime 
36782,the river 
36783,laudable 
36784,this overproduced piece of dreck 
36785,there is a beautiful  aching sadness to it all  
36786,a keep  em  guessing plot and an affectionate take on its screwedup characters 
36787,vibrance and 
36788,cute animals and 
36789,tells this very compelling tale with little fuss or noise 
36790,going on inside each trailer park you drive past  even if it chiefly inspires you to drive a little faster 
36791,fauxurban 
36792,s most memorable about circuit 
36793,feels like very light errol morris  focusing on eccentricity but failing  ultimately  to make something bigger out of its scrapbook of oddballs 
36794,audiences are advised to sit near the back and squint to avoid noticing some truly egregious lipnonsynching  
36795,semiamusing to watch robert deniro belt out  when you re a jet 
36796,its almost toospectacular coastal setting distracts slightly from an eccentric and goodnaturedly aimless story  
36797, alloverthemap movie would be a lot better if it pared down its plots and characters to a few rather than dozens  or if it were subtler  or if it had a sense of humor  
36798,a few grossout comedies i ve been trying to forget 
36799,reassuring 
36800,with the visceral sensation of longing  lasting traces of charlotte s web of desire and desperation 
36801,very talented but underutilized 
36802,extraordinary journalism 
36803,works more often than it does nt 
36804,skillfully assembled  highly polished and professional adaptation 
36805,with nary a glimmer of selfknowledge   crane  becomes more specimen than character  and auto focus remains a chilly  clinical lab report 
36806,a bland  obnoxious 88minute infomercial for universal studios and its ancillary products  
36807,it s just a movie that happens to have jackie chan in it  
36808,good  hardedged stuff  violent and a bit exploitative but also nicely done  morally alert and streetsmart 
36809,foulmouthed 
36810,sarah s dedication to finding her husband seems more psychotic than romantic  and nothing in the movie makes a convincing case that one woman s broken heart outweighs all the loss we witness  
36811,the tale has turned from sweet to bittersweet  and when the tears come during that final  beautiful scene  they finally feel absolutely earned 
36812,particularly amateurish episode 
36813,failed jokes  
36814,downward 
36815,s tough to watch 
36816,tragedies 
36817,a smart and funny  albeit sometimes superficial  cautionary tale of a technology in search 
36818,as with all ambitious films  it has some problems 
36819,a frustrating patchwork 
36820,like those dw griffith made in the early days of silent film 
36821,cheap  ludicrous attempt 
36822,deftly executed 
36823,hugh grant s act is so consuming that sometimes it s difficult to tell who the other actors in the movie are  
36824,not even solondz s thirst for controversy  sketchy characters and immature provocations can fully succeed at cheapening it  
36825,chance to shine 
36826,to be somebody  and 
36827,is shrewd enough to activate girlish tear ducts does nt mean it s good enough for our girls 
36828,would ve reeked of a beenthere  donethat sameness  
36829,sexual relationship 
36830,of the national lampoon film franchise  too long reduced to directtovideo irrelevancy 
36831,for the film s winning tone 
36832,the movie s major and most devastating flaw is its reliance on formula  though  and it s quite enough to lessen the overall impact the movie could have had  
36833,the enjoyable undercover brother 
36834,is felt  not the craven of  a nightmare on elm street  or  the hills have eyes   but the sad schlock merchant of  deadly friend 
36835,rant 
36836,is not one of the movies you d want to watch if you only had a week to live 
36837,has all the sibling rivalry and general family chaos to which anyone can relate  
36838,when you find yourself rooting for the monsters in a horror movie  you know the picture is in trouble  
36839,inactive 
36840,worst films 
36841,ruined by amateurish writing and acting  while the third feels limited by its short running time 
36842, they ca nt go wrong  
36843,the film has the uncanny ability to right itself precisely when you think it s in danger of going wrong  
36844,the bigfisted direction of jez butterworth  who manages to blast even the smallest sensitivities from the romance with his clamorous approach 
36845, the play more has partly closed it down  
36846, nonsensical and formulaic 
36847,sexy beast 
36848, we need agile performers 
36849,entertainingly 
36850,tedious it makes the silly spy vs spy film the sum of all fears  starring ben affleck  seem downright hitchcockian 
36851,the brawn  but not the brains 
36852,this might have been an eerie thriller 
36853,solidly 
36854,a farrelly brothersstyle  downanddirty laugher 
36855,plays out  like a highend john hughes comedy  a kind of elder bueller s time out  
36856,s burns  visuals  characters and his punchy dialogue  not his plot  that carry waydowntown  
36857,s a bargainbasement european pickup  
36858,inventive  consistently intelligent and sickeningly savage 
36859,conned 
36860,it s kinda dumb  
36861,video  and 
36862,beautiful  angry and sad  with a curious sick poetry  as if the marquis de sade 
36863,userfriendly 
36864,the performances elicit more of a sense of deja vu than awe 
36865,a very distinctive sensibility  
36866,a movie as artificial and soulless 
36867,broomfield s style of journalism is hardly journalism at all  and 
36868,us to endure every plot contrivance that the clichériddled genre can offer 
36869,its predecessors proud 
36870,by mediocrity 
36871,keep it entertaining 
36872,is  the comedy equivalent of saddam hussein  and i m just about ready to go to the un and ask permission for a preemptive strike 
36873,s mildly sentimental  unabashedly consumerist  studiously inoffensive and completely disposable  
36874,done and perfectly 
36875,the action here is unusually tame  the characters are too simplistic to maintain interest  
36876,they do in this marvelous film 
36877,is simply not enough of interest onscreen to sustain its seventyminute running time 
36878,feels more like an extended  openended poem than a traditionally structured story 
36879,the film rehashes several old themes and is capped with pointless extremes  it s insanely violent and very graphic  
36880,rapepayback 
36881,of the pool with an utterly incompetent conclusion 
36882,a weak script that ca nt support the epic treatment 
36883,is more of an ordeal than an amusement  
36884, murder hits and generally sustains a higher plateau with bullock s memorable first interrogation of gosling  
36885,jiang wen s devils on the doorstep is a wartime farce in the alternately comic and gutwrenching style of joseph heller or kurt vonnegut  
36886,like a drunken driver 
36887, unbearably lame  
36888,now it is a copy of a copy of a copy 
36889,the underworld urban angst is derivative of martin scorsese s taxi driver and goodfellas  but this film speaks for itself  
36890,are just too many characters saying too many clever things and getting into too many pointless situations 
36891,brings an irresistible blend of warmth and humor and a consistent embracing humanity in the face of life s harshness  
36892,less sense than the bruckheimeresque american action flicks it emulates 
36893,of hope 
36894,is an impressive achievement in spite of a river of sadness that pours into every frame  
36895,this wretchedly unfunny wannabe comedy is inane and awful  no doubt  it s the worst movie i ve seen this summer 
36896,a wretched movie that reduces the second world war to one man s quest to find an old flame  
36897,a raison detre that s as freshfaced as its youngguns cast 
36898,is  by itself  deserving of discussion 
36899,gives a superb performance full of deep feeling  
36900,tackles the difficult subject of grief and loss with such lifeembracing spirit that the theme does nt drag an audience down  
36901,an accessible introduction 
36902, but far more witty 
36903,this wedding 
36904,exceptional honesty 
36905,is more than a movie  
36906,too many 
36907,uglyduckling 
36908,a fine job of updating white s dry wit to a new age 
36909,mostly repetitive 
36910,the big screen postcard that is a selfglorified martin lawrence lovefest 
36911,the director s many dodges and turns 
36912,the anthropomorphic animal characters are beautifully realized through clever makeup design  leaving one to hope that the eventual dvd release will offer subtitles and the original italianlanguage soundtrack 
36913,none of which ever seem to hit 
36914,while thurman and lewis give what can easily be considered careerbest performances 
36915,are so unmemorable  despite several attempts at lengthy dialogue scenes  
36916,handily 
36917,it s fun  wispy  wise and surprisingly inoffensive for a film about a teen in love with his stepmom  
36918,dutifully pulling on heartstrings 
36919, kline s  utterly convincing  and deeply appealing  as a noble teacher who embraces a strict moral code  
36920,an oscarworthy performance 
36921,the bland songs 
36922,succeeds as a powerful look at a failure of our justice system  
36923,kind of special 
36924,that s unafraid to throw elbows when necessary 
36925,rush to the theater 
36926,end all chases 
36927,a fan 
36928,be mindless without being the peak of all things insipid 
36929,all its strange quirks 
36930,have failed 
36931,proficiently enough to trounce its overly comfortable trappings 
36932,director jay russell weighs down his capricious fairytale with heavy sentiment and lightweight meaning  
36933,had the inclination to make the most sincere and artful movie in which adam sandler will probably ever appear 
36934,s virtually impossible to like any of these despicable characters  
36935,is  in a word  brilliant 
36936,s not a spark of new inspiration in it  just more of the same  done with noticeably less energy and imagination  
36937,well 
36938,most damning 
36939,force himself on people and into situations that would make lesser men run for cover 
36940,that the material is so secondrate 
36941,by the time the credits roll across the pat ending 
36942,serves as a workable primer for the region s recent history  and would make a terrific 10thgrade learning tool 
36943,trapped and 
36944,enjoyed it just as much  
36945,tale 
36946,in any case  i would recommend big bad love only to winger fans who have missed her since 1995 s forget paris  
36947,would be hardpressed to find a movie with a bigger  fatter heart than barbershop  
36948,elicits strong performances 
36949,good qualities 
36950,paranoia 
36951,mainly because blanchett and ribisi compellingly tap into a spiritual aspect of their characters  suffering 
36952,in this engaging film about two men who discover what william james once called  the gift of tears 
36953,his life  his dignity and his music 
36954,looks great  has solid acting and a neat premise 
36955,disconcertingly 
36956,mel 
36957,realism  crisp storytelling 
36958,supposed to feel funny and light 
36959,scare 
36960,seemingly eternal running time to pique your interest  your imagination  your empathy or anything  really  save your disgust and your indifference 
36961,catches dramatic fire 
36962,recycling 
36963,broomfield has compelling new material but he does nt unveil it until the end  after endless scenes of him wheedling reluctant witnesses and pointing his camera through the smeared windshield of his rental car  
36964,you feel like running out screaming 
36965,with a sharp script and strong performances 
36966, and not in a good way 
36967,been there  done that  a thousand times already  and better  
36968,sneaks up on the viewer 
36969,gasp 
36970,do you make a movie with depth about a man who lacked any  
36971,decorous 
36972,gets vivid performances 
36973,as my friend david cross would call it   hungryman portions of bad  
36974,a dashing and absorbing 
36975,that a decent draft in the auditorium might blow it off the screen 
36976,a buoyant  expressive flow 
36977,such highwattage brainpower coupled with pitchperfect acting and 
36978,the plot  and a maddeningly insistent and repetitive piano score that made me want to scream 
36979,by storm 
36980, it s pleasant enough and its ecological  prowildlife sentiments are certainly welcome  
36981, violent  selfindulgent and maddening 
36982, payami graphically illustrates the problems of fledgling democracies  but also the strength and sense of freedom the iranian people already possess  with or without access to the ballot box  
36983,no such thing is sort of a minimalist beauty and the beast  but in this case the beast should definitely get top billing  
36984,to the french to truly capture the terrifying angst of the modern working man without turning the film into a cheap thriller  a dumb comedy or a sappy melodrama 
36985,assured in its execution 
36986,a terrible movie 
36987,illuminated 
36988,poignant if familiar story of a young person 
36989,homogenized and a bit contrived 
36990,the rage and alienation that fuels the selfdestructiveness of many young people 
36991,is about the people who live in them  who have carved their own comfortable niche in the world and have been kind enough to share it 
36992,producer john penotti 
36993,is one of those crazy  mixedup films that does nt know what it wants to be when it grows up 
36994,smart to vary the pitch of his movie  balancing deafening battle scenes with quieter domestic scenes of women back home receiving war department telegrams 
36995,from being a total rehash 
36996,international acclaim 
36997,his selfinflicted retaliation 
36998,you enjoy more because you re one of the lucky few who sought it out 
36999,pt anderson understands the grandness of romance 
37000,something  one that attempts and often achieves a level of connection and concern

37002,eludes madonna and  playing a charmless witch 
37003,fastpaced 
37004,of a film that does nt know what it wants to be 
37005,the story is lacking any real emotional impact  and the plot is both contrived and cliched 
37006,perceptive 
37007,s kinda dumb  
37008,opens today 
37009,dead gorgeous

37013,about sorority boys 
37014,feels like a book report 
37015,dull  inconsistent  dishonest 
37016,neither light nor magical enough to bring off this kind of whimsy 
37017,the most accomplished work 
37018,this rush to profits

37020,the masses with star power  a popinduced score and sentimental

37025,directed the film from the back of a taxicab 
37026,the marvelous verdu 
37027,has a builtin audience  but only among those who are drying out from spring break 
37028,would anyone cast the magnificent jackie chan in a movie full of stunt doubles and special effects  
37029,zoe clarkewilliams s lackluster thriller  new best friend   who needs enemies 
37030,sandler running on empty  repeating what he s already done way too often 
37031,is a riot  
37032,of demme s good films 
37033,but  in trying to capture the novel s deeper intimate resonances  the film has  ironically  distanced us from the characters  
37034,they show a remarkable ability to document both sides of this emotional carwreck  
37035,structure and 
37036,druginduced bowel 
37037,matter  but one whose lessons are well worth revisiting as many times as possible 
37038,does nt deliver a great story  
37039,soulsearching 
37040,is masterful  
37041,a zippy 96 minutes of mediocre special effects  hoary dialogue  fluxing accents  and  worst of all  sillylooking morlocks 
37042,the work of a genuine and singular artist 
37043,s nowhere near as good as the original 
37044,really good premise 
37045,of a determined woman s courage to find her husband in a war zone 
37046,just is nt worth telling 
37047,never rises to its clever whatif concept  
37048,an empty shell of an epic rather than the real deal  
37049,by the time the credits roll across the pat ending  a warm  fuzzy feeling prevails 
37050,you know there s something there

37138,unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest 
37139,moral favorite 
37140,ll be wistful for the testosteronecharged wizardry of jerry bruckheimer productions  especially because half past dead is like the rock on a walmart budget

37977,both a great and a terrible story 
37978,for taking the sometimes improbable story and making it 
37979,is that it s far too sentimental  
37980,when the movie ended so damned soon 
37981,may take its sweet time to get wherever it s going 
37982,wise 
37983,is very difficult to care about the character 
37984,slow and 
37985,as jolie s hideous yellow  do 
37986,you do nt know whether to admire the film s stately nature and call it classicism or be exasperated by a noticeable lack of pace  
37987,of the greatest natural sportsmen of modern times 
37988,awe and affection 
37989,smart and alert 
37990,in a movie full of surprises 
37991,about this traditional thriller  moderately successful but not completely satisfying  is exactly how genteel and unsurprising the execution turns out to be  
37992,is  a fascinating character 
37993,s neither as funny nor as charming as it thinks it is 
37994,s not as obnoxious as tom green s freddie got fingered 
37995,a film with almost as many delights for adults as there are for children and dog lovers  
37996,with results that are sometimes bracing  sometimes baffling and quite often  and in unexpected ways  touching 
37997,serene  the humor wry and sprightly 
37998,picture that does not move 
37999,a really long  slow and dreary time 
38000,mad 
38001,below expectations 
38002,unattractive or odorous 
38003,contrived  unmotivated 
38004,like a soft drink that s been sitting open too long  it s too much syrup and not enough fizz 
38005,to work with  sort of like michael jackson s nose 
38006,there s no energy  
38007,dullest 
38008,insufferable movie 
38009,a delightful little film that revels in its own simplicity 
38010,carrying 
38011,a tough pill to swallow and 
38012,is we never really see her esther blossom as an actress  even though her talent is supposed to be growing 
38013,surprisingly  the film is a hilarious adventure and i shamelessly enjoyed it  
38014,befallen 
38015,s encouraging to see a threedimensional  average  middleaged woman s experience of selfdiscovery handled with such sensitivity 
38016, it feels more forced than usual  
38017,lopez s publicist should share screenwriting credit 
38018,leaves a bitter taste 
38019,comes to resemble the kind of softcore twaddle you d expect to see on showtime s  red shoe diaries   
38020,it all seemed wasted like deniro s once promising career and the once grand long beach boardwalk  
38021,director nancy savoca s nofrills record of a show forged in stillraw emotions 
38022,seems to have ransacked every old world war ii movie for overly familiar material  
38023,is there a group of more selfabsorbed women than the mother and daughters featured in this film  
38024,they shovel into their mental gullets to simulate sustenance 
38025,a calm  selfassured portrait of small town regret  love  duty and friendship 
38026,most pleasurable expressions of pure movie 
38027,good to be bad 
38028,amusing enough 
38029, pretentious mess  
38030,by a rich visual clarity and deeply 
38031,their often heartbreaking testimony  spoken directly into director patricio guzman s camera 
38032,what a great way to spend 4 units of your day 
38033, austin powers in goldmember has some unnecessary parts and is kinda wrong in places  
38034,barely camouflaging grotesque narcissism 
38035,highlighted by kwan s unique directing style 
38036,sappy  preachy one 
38037,the tiresome rant of an aging filmmaker still thumbing his nose at convention 
38038,with considerable aplomb 
38039,an effective portrait of a life in stasis 
38040,that it also makes her appear foolish and shallow rather than  as was more likely  a victim of mental illness 
38041,such a vibrant  colorful world 
38042,the four feathers is definitely horse feathers  but if you go in knowing that  you might have fun in this cinematic sandbox  
38043,a taut  sobering film 
38044,nothing less than a provocative piece of work 
38045,his cinematic vision 
38046,s secondary to american psycho but still has claws enough to get inside you and stay there for a couple of hours 
38047,it tends to remind one of a really solid woody allen film  with its excellent use of new york locales and sharp writing 
38048,a giant pile of elephant feces 
38049,deep bow 
38050,avid 
38051,the year s greatest adventure  and jackson s limited but enthusiastic adaptation has made literature literal without killing its soul  a feat any thinking person is bound to appreciate  
38052,affirms the nourishing aspects of love and companionship 
38053,read my lips with such provocative material 
38054,with us 
38055,adventurous 
38056,the best comedy concert movie i ve seen since cho s previous concert comedy film  i m the one that i want  in 2000  
38057,might be distracted by the movie s quick movements and 
38058,the latest vapid actor s exercise to appropriate the structure of arthur schnitzler s reigen  
38059,like some like it 
38060,is an undeniably fascinating and playful fellow  
38061,the kind of softcore twaddle 
38062,figures out how to make us share their enthusiasm 
38063,this comic gem 
38064,opposed to the extent of their outrageousness 
38065,is a sweet and modest and ultimately winning story 
38066,standard 
38067,grossout flicks  college flicks  or 
38068,churlish 
38069,stale first act  scrooge story  blatant product placement  some very good comedic songs  strong finish 
38070, a question comes to mind  so why is this so boring  
38071,the major problem with windtalkers is that the bulk of the movie centers on the wrong character  
38072,powerful success 
38073,awful as some of the recent hollywood trip tripe 
38074,period trappings 
38075,jumbled 
38076,they can and will turn on a dime from oddly humorous to tediously sentimental  
38077,i do nt think most of the people who loved the 1989 paradiso will prefer this new version  
38078,boring and 
38079,city by the sea swings from one approach to the other  but in the end  it stays in formula  which is a waste of de niro  mcdormand and the other good actors in the cast 
38080,low  very low  very 
38081,is left puzzled by the mechanics of the delivery 
38082,absolutely not  
38083,been  pardon the pun  sucked out 
38084,beautiful images and solemn words 
38085,is a bomb  
38086,as nudity  profanity and violence 
38087,far more enjoyable than its predecessor  
38088,with false starts 
38089,one of the best love stories of any stripe 
38090,that even in sorrow you can find humor 
38091,the cartoons look almost shakespearean  both in depth and breadth  after watching this digitaleffectsheavy  supposed familyfriendly comedy  
38092,its visual panache and compelling supporting characters 
38093,a sadistic bike flick 
38094,breathes more 
38095,a real winner  
38096,yes  but also intriguing and honorable  a worthwhile addition to a distinguished film legacy  
38097,s no energy 
38098,crystallize key plot moments 
38099,willing to let the earnestness of its execution and skill of its cast take you down a familiar road with a few twists 
38100,into comedy futility 
38101,visually striking and viscerally repellent  
38102,jell with sean penn s monotone narration 
38103,of the most entertaining monster movies in ages 
38104,surprises you with unexpected comedy 
38105,a cliché 
38106,highly professional film that s oldfashioned in all the best possible ways 
38107,as an entertainment destination for the general public  kung pow sets a new benchmark for lameness  
38108,rewritten  and for the uncompromising knowledge that the highest power of all is the power of love 
38109,see it  
38110,the multilayers 
38111,almost no organic intrigue 
38112,is easy to take this film at face value and enjoy its slightly humorous and tender story 
38113,ills 
38114,welcome step 
38115,colorful 
38116,ca nt help but get caught up in the thrill of the company s astonishing growth 
38117,unflinching and objective look 
38118,a baffling subplot involving smuggling drugs inside danish cows falls flat  and if you re going to alter the bard s ending  you d better have a good alternative  
38119,what kind of sewage they shovel into their mental gullets to simulate sustenance 
38120,phillip noyce and all of his actors  as well as his cinematographer  christopher doyle  understand the delicate forcefulness of greene s prose 
38121,quite an achievement 
38122,an action icon 
38123,annoyed me most about god is great 
38124,stuck in a dark pit having a nightmare about bad cinema 
38125,to the gorgeous locales and exceptional lead performances 
38126,fails to arrive at any satisfying destination 
38127,an inspirational love story 
38128,filled with humorous observations about the general absurdity of modern life as seen through the eyes outsiders 
38129,with a cast of alist brit actors 
38130,is repellantly out of control  
38131,feeling a little sticky and unsatisfied 
38132,it s a beautiful film  full of elaborate and twisted characters  
38133,less than adorable 
38134,a venturesome  beautifully realized psychological mood piece 
38135,a clever pseudobio that manages to have a good time as it doles out pieces of the famous director s life 
38136,funny moments 
38137, red shoe diaries 
38138,magic and whimsy for children  a heartfelt romance for teenagers and a compelling argument about death 
38139,it has more in common with a fireworks display than a movie  which normally is expected to have characters and a storyline  
38140,to imagine that even very small children will be impressed by this tired retread 
38141,a lazy exercise in bad filmmaking that asks you to not only suspend your disbelief but your intelligence as well 
38142,ca nt help but engage an audience 
38143,begins to resemble the shapeless  grasping actors  workshop that it is 
38144,the beauty and power 
38145,certainly the big finish was nt something galinsky and hawley could have planned for  but part of being a good documentarian is being there when the rope snaps  
38146,real writer plot 
38147,virtuous 
38148,does nt deliver a great story  nor is the action as gripping as in past seagal films 
38149,edge to it  
38150,is an amicable endeavor  
38151,for more than two decades mr nachtwey has traveled to places in the world devastated by war  famine and poverty and documented the cruelty and suffering he has found with an devastating  eloquent clarity  
38152, poorly structured 
38153,marvelous film 
38154,a lame comedy  
38155,soon becomes a questionable kind of inexcusable dumb innocence 
38156,rank frustration from those in the know about rubbo s dumbeddown tactics 
38157,a phlegmatic bore  so tedious it makes the silly spy vs spy film the sum of all fears  starring ben affleck  seem downright hitchcockian 
38158, matrix   style massacres erupt throughout  but the movie has a tougher time balancing its violence with kafkainspired philosophy 
38159,your disgust 
38160,calm us of our daily ills and bring out joys in our lives that we never knew 
38161,confessions is nt always coherent  but it s sharply comic and surprisingly touching  so hold the gong  
38162,lacks the visual panache  the comic touch  and perhaps the budget of sommers s titlebout features  
38163,although  visually striking and slickly staged  it s also cold  gray  antiseptic and emotionally desiccated  
38164,it with ring  an indisputably spooky film  
38165,by an imaginatively mixed cast of antic spirits 
38166,what it s trying to say and 
38167,a playedout idea  a straight guy has to dress up in drag  
38168,unless one considers cliched dialogue and perverse escapism a source of high hilarity 
38169,is grossly contradictory in conveying its social message  if indeed there is one  
38170,director shekhar kapur and screenwriters michael schiffer and hossein amini have tried hard to modernize and reconceptualize things  but the barriers finally prove to be too great 
38171,of a thousand cliches 
38172,at the screen in frustration 
38173,stevens has a flair for dialogue comedy  the film operates nicely off the element of surprise  and 
38174,this fascinating experiment 
38175,the young stars are too cute  the story and ensuing complications are too manipulative 
38176,of bittersweet camaraderie and history 
38177,strong education 
38178,the fun wears thin  then out  when there s nothing else happening 
38179,wholly 
38180,collateral damage is trash  but 
38181,felt trapped and with no obvious escape for the entire 100 minutes 
38182,not that i mind ugly  the problem is he has no character  loveable or otherwise  
38183,funny with the material 
38184,an overstylized  puréed mélange of sex  psychology  drugs and philosophy 
38185,goes on for too long and bogs down in a surfeit of characters and unnecessary subplots  
38186,of the situation in a wellbalanced fashion 
38187,tries to work in the same vein as the brilliance of animal house but instead comes closer to the failure of the third revenge of the nerds sequel  
38188,with their memorable and resourceful performances 
38189,mayhem and stupidity 
38190,wait for the video 
38191,less concerned with cultural and political issues 
38192,has become the master of innuendo 
38193,our deepest  mediasoaked fears 
38194,a movie  which normally is expected to have characters and a storyline 
38195,writerdirector alexander payne  election  and his cowriter jim taylor brilliantly employ their quirky and fearless ability to look american angst in the eye and end up laughing  
38196,elegant  witty and beneath 
38197,neofascism 
38198,of the word  mindless  lifeless  meandering  loud  painful  obnoxious

38202,great time 
38203,sharp  amusing study 
38204,best possible 
38205,is good news to anyone who s fallen under the sweet  melancholy spell of this unique director s previous films 
38206,i liked the movie 
38207,ongoing  and unprecedented  
38208,out to be 
38209,has stepped into the mainstream of filmmaking with an assurance worthy of international acclaim and with every cinematic tool well under his control  driven by a natural sense for what works on screen  
38210,most certainly has a new career ahead of him 
38211,it s this rich and luscious 
38212,a generic bloodbath that often becomes laughably unbearable when it is nt merely offensive  
38213,compelling storyline 
38214,serenity and poise 
38215,liberal doses 
38216,a stirring tribute to the bravery and dedication of the world s reporters who willingly walk into the nightmare of war not only to record the events for posterity  but to help us clearly see the world of our making  
38217,an occasionally interesting but mostly repetitive look at a slice of counterculture that might be best forgotten  
38218,the lord of the rings 
38219,miss it 
38220,incisive and 
38221,green is  the comedy equivalent of saddam hussein  and i m just about ready to go to the un and ask permission for a preemptive strike  
38222,to infuse the rocky path to sibling reconciliation with flashes of warmth and gentle humor 
38223,good simmer 
38224,if considerably less ambitious 
38225,a frightening and compelling 
38226,it s as comprehensible as any dummies guide  something even nontechies can enjoy  
38227,hot 
38228,boasts a handful of virtuosic set pieces and offers a fair amount of trashy  kinky fun  
38229,bring fresh good looks and an ease in front of the camera 
38230,it will probably be a talky bore  
38231,glamorous 
38232, a warm  fuzzy feeling prevails 
38233,more fascinating  being real  
38234,undercuts the joie de vivre even as he creates it  giving the movie a mournful undercurrent that places the goodtime shenanigans in welcome perspective 
38235,surprisingly powerful and universal 
38236,a refreshing change 
38237,one viewing ca nt possibly be enough 
38238,this is one of those war movies that focuses on human interaction rather than battle and action sequences  
38239,goodnatured ensemble comedy 
38240, salvation and good intentions 
38241,can prevent its tragic waste of life 
38242,by bad writing 
38243,rocksolid gangster movie 
38244,are so unmemorable 
38245,schaeffer s film never settles into the lightfooted enchantment the material needs 
38246,something of a public service  shedding light on a group of extremely talented musicians who might otherwise go unnoticed and underappreciated by music fans 
38247,a guiltless film for nice evening out 
38248, tortured 
38249,though it pretends to expose the life of male hustlers  it s exploitive without being insightful  
38250,all its brilliant touches 
38251,a tone that s alternately melancholic  hopeful and strangely funny 
38252,despite playing out like a featurelength sitcom replete with stereotypical familial quandaries 
38253,vulgar is too optimistic a title  
38254,clarity and emotional 
38255,a convincing case that one woman s broken heart outweighs all the loss we witness 
38256,ozpetek s effort has the scope and shape of an especially wellexecuted television movie  
38257,loosely connected characters and 
38258,that rare documentary that incorporates so much of human experience  drama  conflict  tears and surprise  that it transcends the normal divisions between fiction and nonfiction film 
38259,shallow 
38260,sweeping  dramatic  
38261,fabulous 
38262,i recommend it for its originality alone 
38263,occasionally very enjoyable 
38264,enlightening 
38265,opens today in the new york metropolitan area 
38266,a downer and 
38267,a joy to watch and  especially  to listen to 
38268,of randomness usually achieved only by lottery drawing 
38269,set in the world of lingerie models and bar dancers in the midwest that held my interest precisely because it did nt try to 
38270,an artist who is simply tired  of fighting the same fights  of putting the weight of the world on his shoulders  of playing with narrative form 
38271,jumps around with little logic or continuity  presenting backstage bytes of information that never amount to a satisfying complete picture of this particular  anciently demanding métier 
38272,is enough to make you put away the guitar  sell the amp  and apply to medical school  
38273,alienate the mainstream audience 
38274,fragmentary 
38275,an honestly nice little film 
38276,its own quirky hipness 
38277,snore 
38278,is a big  juicy role 
38279,the film sounds like the stuff of lurid melodrama  but what makes it interesting as a character study is the fact that the story is told from paul s perspective  
38280,too stagey  talky  and long  for its own good  
38281, stay away  
38282,this is the case of a pregnant premise being wasted by a script that takes few chances and manages to insult the intelligence of everyone in the audience  
38283,direction and especially charm 
38284,a troubled and determined homicide cop 
38285,is not even as daring as john ritter s glory days 
38286,down a familiar road with a few twists 
38287,some laughs and 
38288,do nt deserve any oscars 
38289,into the art film pantheon 
38290,unexceptional 
38291,feel that you never want to see another car chase  explosion or gunfight again 
38292, the humor wry and sprightly 
38293,the otherwise goodnaturedness of mr deeds  with its embrace of sheer goofiness and cameos 
38294,a wild ride 
38295,revealing nothing about the pathology it pretends to investigate 
38296,has some of the funniest jokes of any movie this year 
38297,as giddy and whimsical and relevant today as it was 270 years ago  
38298,it has just as many scenes that are lean and tough enough to fit in any modern action movie 
38299,be even worse than its title 
38300,a triumph 
38301,is a light  fun cheese puff of a movie 
38302,the characters are based on stock clichés  and the attempt to complicate the story only defies credibility  
38303,takes every potential laugh and stilettostomps the life out of it  
38304,thoroughly unrewarding all of this 
38305,it s simply baffling 
38306,throws in enough clever and unexpected 
38307,while it is welcome to see a chinese film depict a homosexual relationship in a mature and frank fashion  lan yu never catches dramatic fire  
38308,intimidated by both her subject matter and the period trappings of this debut venture into the heritage business 
38309,see scratch for the history  see scratch for the music  see scratch for a lesson in scratching  but  most of all  see it for the passion  
38310,bore most audiences into their own brightly colored dreams 
38311,nothing but boilerplate clichés from start to finish 
38312,no way to entertain or inspire its viewers

38321,an oldfashioned scary movie  one that relies on lingering terror punctuated by sudden shocks and not constant bloodshed punctuated by flying guts  
38322,is hindered by a central plot that s peppered with false starts and populated by characters who are nearly impossible to care about 
38323,the imagery in this chiaroscuro of madness and light 
38324,it would nt exist without the precedent of yiddish theater  whose jolly  funforfun s  sake communal spirit goes to the essence of broadway

38330,the earnestness 
38331,prominent

38348,one of the year s worst cinematic tragedies 
38349,halfway through  however  having sucked dry the undead action flick formula  blade ii mutates into a grossout monster movie with effects that are more silly than scary  
38350,spirit is a visual treat  and it takes chances that are bold by studio standards 
38351,to screen with considerable appeal intact 
38352,it reduces the complexities to bromides and slogans and it gets so preachykeen and so tubthumpingly loud it makes you feel like a chump just for sitting through it 
38353,incoherent  instantly disposable 
38354,the worst kind of mythologizing

38934, del toro maintains a dark mood that makes the film seem like something to endure instead of enjoy  
38935, looking for leonard  just seems to kinda sit in neutral  hoping for a stiff wind to blow it uphill or something

38947,as with so many merchandisedtothemax movies of this type  more time appears to have gone into recruiting the right bands for the playlist and the costuming of the stars than into the script  which has a handful of smart jokes and not much else

39169,of new york s finest and a nicely understated expression of the grief 
39170,robin williams has thankfully ditched the saccharine sentimentality of bicentennial man in favor of an altogether darker side  
39171,a wellbalanced fashion 
39172,that it s a rocksolid little genre picture 
39173,sympathetic without being gullible 
39174,irrelevant as on the engaging  which gradually turns what 
39175,to fill time 
39176,s the image that really tells the tale 
39177,care about a film that proposes as epic tragedy the plight of a callow rich boy who is forced to choose between his beautiful  selfsatisfied 22yearold girlfriend and an equally beautiful  selfsatisfied 18yearold mistress 
39178,selfindulgent and maddening 
39179,has fashioned an absorbing look at provincial bourgeois french society  
39180,the richness of characterization 
39181,i was trying to decide what annoyed me most about god is great  
39182,being rewarded by a script that assumes you are nt very bright 
39183, this melancholic film noir reminded me a lot of memento  
39184,a painful elegy and 
39185,is a sea of constant smiles and frequent laughter 
39186,and engaging examination 
39187,a whole lot of fun

39192,bad company 
39193,a surprising winner with both adults and younger audiences 
39194,dry  reliable textbook 
39195,the only fun part of the movie 
39196,under a red bridge is a celebration of feminine energy  a tribute to the power of women to heal  
39197,the pungent bite 
39198,spy is still fun and enjoyable and so aggressively silly that it s more than a worthwhile effort  
39199,the sweet cinderella story 
39200,s not clear 
39201,settles too easily 
39202,in which fear and frustration are provoked to intolerable levels 
39203,xxx is a blast of adrenalin 
39204,charming 
39205,imagine kevin smith  the blasphemous bad boy of suburban jersey  if he were stripped of most of his budget and all of his sense of humor  
39206,greek to anyone not predisposed to the movie s rude and crude humor 
39207,hardwon rewards over the bombastic selfglorification of other feelgood fiascos like antwone fisher or the emperor s club any time 
39208,often messy and frustrating  but very pleasing at its best moments 
39209,elbowed aside 
39210,the film grows as dull as its characters  about whose fate it is hard to care  
39211,cared much about any aspect of it  from its cheesy screenplay to the grayish quality of its lighting 
39212,comic elements 
39213,undercuts the devastatingly telling impact of utter loss personified in the film s simple title 
39214,an arcane area of popular culture 
39215,how sandler is losing his touch 
39216,borrows a bit from the classics  wait until dark  and  extremities   but in terms of its style  the movie is in a class by itself  
39217,in the spirit of the season 
39218,barnburningly 
39219,the incredible imax sound system lets you feel the beat down to your toes 
39220,trying to make head or tail of the story in the hiphop indie snipes is enough to give you brain strain  
39221,exercise in narcissism and selfcongratulation disguised as a tribute  
39222,a far bigger  far more meaningful story than one 
39223,pleasurable 
39224,original in its base concept that you can not help but get caught up  
39225, the story simply putters along looking for astute observations and coming up blank  
39226,piercingly affecting  while clearly a manipulative film  emerges as powerful rather than cloying  
39227,s still a guilty pleasure to watch 
39228,uncanny tale 
39229,to see the one of the world s best actors  daniel auteuil  
39230,for a guy who has waited three years with breathless anticipation for a new hal hartley movie to pore over  no such thing is a big letdown  
39231,threedimensional characters 
39232,things to like 
39233,a deserved cowinner 
39234,you re a jet all the way 
39235,the first 23 of the film are incredibly captivating and insanely funny  thanks in part to interesting cinematic devices  cool visual backmasking   a solid cast  and some wickedly sick and twisted humor  
39236,a lot of fun  with an undeniable energy sparked by two actresses in their 50s working at the peak of their powers  
39237,several cliched movie structures  the road movie  the comingofage movie  
39238,there s no real sense of suspense  and none of the plot  surprises  are really surprising 
39239,on the premise 
39240,just slopped  em together here 
39241,is nt a terrible movie  just a stultifyingly obvious one  an unrewarding collar for a murder mystery 
39242,a sentimental but entirely irresistible portrait of three 
39243,adrift in various new york city locations 
39244,that s what i liked about it 
39245,unrelated shorts 
39246,screenwriting award 
39247,so badly made on every level that i m actually having a hard time believing people were paid to make it 
39248,energy  intelligence and verve 
39249,straightforward 
39250,why this distinguished actor would stoop so low 
39251,like some futile concoction that was developed hastily after oedekerk 
39252,thirdrate 
39253,valiant 
39254,could be a passable date film 
39255,much smarter and more attentive than it first sets out to be  
39256,the dragons are the real stars of reign of fire and you wo nt be disappointed  
39257,of three 
39258,affirms 
39259,it s a fun adventure movie for kids  of all ages  that like adventure  
39260,dumb  narratively chaotic  visually sloppy  a weird amalgam of  the thing  and a geriatric 
39261,it s that rare family movie  genuine and sweet without relying on animation or dumb humor  
39262,sparking debate and 
39263,s taken one of the world s most fascinating stories and made it dull  lifeless  and irritating 
39264,upsetting and thoughtprovoking  the film has an odd purity that does nt bring you into the characters so much as it has you study them  
39265,pornography or documentary 
39266,walk away 
39267,of watching intelligent people making a movie 
39268,ideal 
39269,about an unsympathetic character and someone who would not likely be so stupid as to get 
39270,inspiring  
39271,each of these stories has the potential for touched by an angel simplicity and sappiness  
39272,recommend this film 
39273,is as close as you can get to an imitation movie 
39274,is nt one true  chan moment   
39275,s so tedious 
39276,does nt add up to much  
39277,it gives poor dana carvey nothing to do that is really funny  and 
39278,mr daylewis roars with leonine power 
39279,polanski s best film 
39280,on a 10year delay 
39281,its elegantly colorful look and sound 
39282,some intriguing questions about the difference between human and android life 
39283,chalk it up as the worst kind of hubristic folly  
39284,moviegoers not already clad in basic black 
39285,is shallow  offensive and redundant 
39286,badly made on every level 
39287,to eat popcorn 
39288,an exceptionally dreary and overwrought bit 
39289,no french people were harmed during the making of this movie  but they were insulted and the audience was put through torture for an hour and a half 
39290,what s missing from this material 
39291,that most frightening of all movies  
39292,most brilliant and brutal 
39293,s lost the politics and the social observation and become just another situation romance about a couple of saps stuck in an inarticulate screenplay  
39294,heartily sick 
39295,and  too  short 
39296,the sequel plays out like a flimsy excuse to give blade fans another look at wesley snipes  iconic hero doing battle with dozens of bad guys  at once  
39297,savory and 
39298,a good simmer 
39299,sting 
39300,one spectacularly uglylooking broad 
39301,warmth and gentle 
39302,the original could ever have hoped to be 
39303,dreary tract 
39304,martial arts and gunplay with too little excitement and zero compelling storyline 
39305,chance to find love in the most unlikely place 
39306,inept filmmaking 
39307,is hilariously  gloriously alive  and quite often hotter than georgia asphalt 
39308,real women may have many agendas  but it also will win you over  in a big way  
39309,has squeezed the life out of whatever idealism american moviemaking ever had 
39310,that is really funny 
39311,the thrills 
39312,third time s the charm  
39313,to get by on humor that is not even as daring as john ritter s glory days on three s company 
39314,watching monkeys flinging their feces at you 
39315,like a can of 2day old coke  
39316,sink it 
39317,the audience was put through torture for an hour and a half 
39318,s also not very good 
39319,unsurprising 
39320,is nt afraid to try any genre and to do it his own way  
39321,s hard to imagine any recent film  independent or otherwise  that makes as much of a mess as this one 
39322,as fresh 
39323,its use of the thriller form to examine the labyrinthine ways in which people s lives cross and change  buffeted by events seemingly out of their control 
39324,by an energy that puts the dutiful efforts of more disciplined gradegrubbers 
39325, it s kind of insulting  both to men and women  
39326,like pieces a bunch of other  better movies slapped together  
39327,shadowy 
39328,brainless  but enjoyably overthetop  the retro gang melodrama 
39329,elegantly crafted but emotionally cold  a puzzle whose intricate construction one can admire but is difficult to connect with on any deeper level  
39330,with passion and attitude 
39331,very funny 
39332,most latenight bull sessions 
39333,a frightful vanity film that  no doubt  pays off what debt miramax felt they owed to benigni 
39334,teens are looking for something to make them laugh 
39335,intriguing whatif premise 
39336,gives the lie to many clichés and showcases a group of dedicated artists 
39337,melds derivative elements into something that is often quite rich and exciting  and always a beauty to behold  
39338,to be something really good 
39339,get an ugly  meanspirited lashing out by an adult who s apparently been forced by his kids to watch too many barney videos 
39340,no match for the insipid script he has crafted with harris goldberg 
39341,of an upper class austrian society 
39342,a huge fan 
39343,lifts this tale of cannibal lust above the ordinary 
39344,violent 
39345,it s not bad prose 
39346,destructive 
39347,many inimitable scenes 
39348,mr goyer s loose  unaccountable direction is technically sophisticated in the worst way  
39349,it certainly wo nt win any awards in the plot department but 
39350,liked this film a lot 
39351,pretentious endeavor 
39352,much of what we see is horrible but 
39353,nazi 
39354,trade center tragedy 
39355,although olivier assayas  elegantly appointed period drama seems  at times  padded with incident in the way of a tooconscientious adaptation 
39356,first lousy guy ritchie imitation 
39357,misses a major opportunity to be truly revelatory about his psyche 
39358,too much of nemesis has a tired  talky feel

39362,feel sad 
39363,if you find comfort in familiarity 
39364,make the most of its own ironic implications 
39365,it s just rather leaden and dull  
39366,this is one that should be thrown back in the river 
39367,sundrenched masterpiece 
39368,a good deal funnier 
39369,who s wise enough to recognize that there are few things in this world more complex  and  as it turns out  more fragile  than happiness 
39370,an excellent job 
39371,redundant and inauthentic

39509,arteta paints a picture of lives lived in a state of quiet desperation  
39510,with an astoundingly rich film 
39511,to win a wide summer audience through wordofmouth reviews

39513,going to be really awful 
39514,a battle of witlessness between a notsobright mother and daughter and an even less capable trio of criminals 
39515,is as conventional as can be 
39516,a direct hit 
39517,project greenlight  winner 
39518,s really an exercise in gross romanticization of the delusional personality type 
39519,than sucking you in  and making you sweat 
39520,i was feeling this movie until it veered off too far into the exxon zone  and left me behind at the station looking for a return ticket to realism  
39521,become wearisome 
39522,manages to avoid many of the condescending stereotypes that so often plague films dealing with the mentally ill 
39523,chilling in its objective portrait of dreary  lost twentyfirst century america  
39524,fact  the best in recent memory 
39525,than like being stuck in a dark pit having a nightmare about bad cinema 
39526,consistently amusing but 
39527,even lazier and 
39528,artful 
39529,to be a new yorker 
39530,is a smorgasbord of soliloquies about nothing delivered by the former mr drew barrymore 
39531,the sword fighting is well done 
39532,much of it is funny  
39533,extremely unpleasant film 
39534,should be able to appreciate the wonderful cinematography and naturalistic acting 
39535,very meticulously but without any passion 
39536,a blair witch  style adventure that plays like a bad soap opera  with passable performances from everyone in the cast  
39537,a sentimental mess

39546,road to perdition does display greatness  and 
39547,the rest of the film  is dudsville  
39548,ultimate point  that everyone should be themselves  
39549,its generic villains lack any intrigue  other than their funny accents  and the action scenes are poorly delivered 
39550,unless you re a fanatic  the best advice is   scooby  do nt  
39551,will find that the road to perdition leads to a satisfying destination 
39552,does a terrific job conjuring up a sinister  menacing atmosphere though unfortunately all the story gives us is flashing red lights  a rattling noise  and a bump on the head 
39553,the rest of the cast was outshined by ll cool j 
39554,nonsensical and laughable

40608,sexy and romantic 
40609,pulls no punches in its depiction of the lives of the papin sister and the events that led to their notorious rise to infamy

41447,the occasional bursts 
41448,wise enough

41482,meyjes  provocative film might be called an example of the haphazardness of evil  
41483,kids will love its fantasy and adventure  and grownups should appreciate its whimsical humor

41498,heartwarming here relies less on forced air than on petter næss  delicate  clever direction  and a wonderful  imaginative script by axel hellstenius  
41499,uses the hugescreen format to make an oldfashioned nature film that educates viewers with words and pictures while entertaining them  
41500,is so convincing

41821,come with the warning  
41822,the plot of the comeback curlers is nt very interesting actually  but what i like about men with brooms and what is kind of special is how the film knows what s unique and quirky about canadians

42887,constructs a hilarious ode to middle america and middle age with this unlikely odyssey 
42888,abrupt 
42889,this oftenhilarious farce manages to generate the belly laughs of lowbrow comedy without sacrificing its highminded appeal  
42890,an overwhelming pleasure 
42891,silly stuff 
42892,is much more pc than the original version  no more racist portraits of indians  for instance  
42893,pop up in a cinematic year already littered with celluloid garbage

42895,constant smiles and frequent laughter 
42896,his sly  intricate magic 
42897,predictable  manipulative stinker 
42898,this is a very ambitious project for a fairly inexperienced filmmaker  but

42902,extremely unpleasant 
42903,for each other 
42904,morally ambiguous and nothing to shout about 
42905,nair just does nt have the necessary selfcontrol to guide a loose  poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy  
42906,unfortunate title 
42907,is the recording industry in the current climate of mergers and downsizing 
42908,a four star performance from kevin kline who unfortunately works with a two star script

42915,looking  sounding and simply feeling like no other film in recent history 
42916,forcing us to endure every plot contrivance that the clichériddled genre can offer 
42917,have ever seen  constantly pulling the rug from underneath us  seeing things from new sides  plunging deeper  getting more intense 
42918,even when there are lulls  the emotions seem authentic 
42919,works because reno

42933,its impressive images 
42934,has a key strength in its willingness to explore its principal characters with honesty  insight and humor  
42935,it s a barely tolerable slog over welltrod ground  
42936,gentle longing 
42937,very compelling 
42938,an already thin story 
42939,uselessly redundant and shamelessly moneygrubbing than most thirdrate horror sequels  
42940,turns the goosepimple genre on its empty head and fills it with spirit  purpose and emotionally bruised characters who add up to more than body count 
42941,90minute dud 
42942,ensures the film never feels draggy  
42943,s so fun about this silly  outrageous  ingenious thriller 
42944,that reminds at every turn of elizabeth berkley s flopping dolphingasm  
42945,a riveting profile of law enforcement  and a visceral  nasty journey into an urban hades 
42946,scruffy  dopey old 
42947,genuine and sweet 
42948,of underinspired  overblown enterprise that gives hollywood sequels a bad name 
42949,i d much rather watch teens poking their genitals into fruit pies 
42950,vaguely interesting  but it s just too too much  
42951,s surprisingly decent  particularly 
42952,he s one of the few  cool  actors who never seems aware of his own coolness  
42953,as though they are having so much fun 
42954,a movie as artificial and soulless as the country bears 
42955,a sloppy  amusing comedy that proceeds from a stunningly unoriginal premise  
42956,overly familiar 
42957,can watch  giggle and get an adrenaline boost without feeling like you ve completely lowered your entertainment standards  
42958,distinguished 
42959,likely to seduce and conquer 
42960,the background  a welcome step 
42961, christian bale s quinn  is  a leather clad grungepirate with a hairdo like gandalf in a windtunnel and a simply astounding corblimeyluvaduck cockney accent   
42962,marveling at these guys  superhuman capacity 
42963,gorgeous film a must for everyone from junior scientists to grownup fish lovers 
42964,before you pay the full ticket price to see  simone   and consider a dvd rental instead 
42965,life s ultimate losers 
42966, what s with the unexplained baboon cameo  
42967,is a slapdash mess 
42968,speeds up 
42969,insanely violent and very graphic 
42970,nurtures the multilayers of its characters  
42971,satisfactorily 
42972,fried in pork 
42973,the emotional depth 
42974,concentrates far too much 
42975,eclipses nearly everything else she s ever done 
42976,populated by characters who are nearly impossible to care about 
42977,familiar and predictable  and 45ths of it 
42978,of things that elevate  glory  above most of its ilk  most notably the mere presence of duvall 
42979,prevents them from firing on all cylinders 
42980,about their lives  loves and the art 
42981,is off his game 
42982,a lot like the imaginary sport it projects onto the screen  loud  violent and mindless  
42983,this is a big  juicy role 
42984,a very complex situation 
42985,it s really well directed 
42986,a valentine sealed with a kiss 
42987,theater feeling

42989,cliches and pabulum 
42990,constant fits of laughter 
42991,wobbly 
42992,secondhand  familiar  and not in a good way 
42993,is a sweet  honest  and enjoyable comedydrama about a young woman who wants many things in life  but fears she ll become her mother before she gets to fulfill her dreams  
42994,in a summer of clones  harvard man is something rare and riveting  a wild ride that relies on more than special effects  
42995,for the most creative mayhem in a brief amount of time 
42996,irresistible 
42997,equilibrium the movie  as opposed to the manifesto  is really  really stupid  
42998, it also has plenty for those  like me  who are nt  
42999,to better understand why this did nt connect with me would require another viewing  and i wo nt be sitting through this one again  that in itself is commentary enough 
43000,a pleasant distraction  a friday night diversion 
43001,dry the undead action flick formula 
43002,dull girl 
43003,bungle their way through the narrative 
43004,yes  i have given this movie a rating of zero  
43005,actually finding the characters in slackers or their antics amusing  let alone funny 
43006,joy to watch  even when her material is not firstrate 
43007,is a general air of exuberance in all about the benjamins that s hard to resist 
43008,the nifty premise 
43009,the sad schlock merchant of  deadly friend 
43010,the film is so bleak that it s hardly watchable 
43011,that welcome to collinwood is nt going to jell 
43012,is that it counts heart as important as humor  
43013,it tries to pump life into overworked elements from eastwood s dirty harry period 
43014,a heavyweight film that fights a good fight on behalf of the world s endangered reefs 
43015,scratching your head in amazement over the fact that so many talented people could participate in such an 
43016,dog soldiers does nt transcend genre  it embraces it  energizes it and takes big bloody chomps out of it 
43017,smooth and professional 
43018,naomi watts is terrific as rachel 
43019,alist brit actors 
43020,grant and bullock make it look as though they are having so much fun 
43021,playful and haunting 
43022,the type of film about growing up that we do nt see often enough these days 
43023,winds up being both revelatory and narcissistic  achieving some honest insight into relationships that most highconcept films candycoat with pat storylines  precious circumstances and beautiful stars  
43024,tossed in 
43025,its story about a young chinese woman  ah na  who has come to new york city to replace past tragedy with the american dream is one that any arthouse moviegoer is likely to find compelling  
43026,for some robust and scary entertainment 
43027,such a pleasure 
43028,shanghai ghetto may not be as dramatic as roman polanski s the pianist  but 
43029,a troubadour 
43030,of that alreadyshallow 
43031,its shapeshifting perils  political intrigue 
43032,even lazier 
43033,on a string of exotic locales 
43034,a fresh way 
43035,the exoticism of its seas of sand to the fierce grandeur of its sweeping battle scenes 
43036, ick  
43037,interminably bleak  to say nothing of boring  
43038,notwithstanding my problem with the movie s final half hour 
43039,it is derivative 
43040,the crackle of lines  the impressive stagings of hardware 
43041,of high art 
43042,despite all the backstage drama 
43043,are cheesy backdrops  ridiculous action sequences  and many tired jokes about men in heels  
43044,squarely fills the screen  
43045,all the queen s men is allegedly  inspired  was a lot funnier and more deftly enacted than what s been cobbled together onscreen 
43046,topbilled star bruce willis 
43047,a good yarn  
43048,too late 
43049,by the time the plot grinds itself out in increasingly incoherent fashion 
43050,a movie that s about as overbearing and overthetop as the family it depicts  
43051,lost the ability to think 
43052, you ca nt help suspecting that it was improvised on a daytoday basis during production  
43053,a sensitive  moving  
43054,if you are curious to see the darker side of what s going on with young tv actors  dawson leery did what    or see some interesting storytelling devices  you might want to check it out  but there s nothing very attractive about this movie 
43055,to flat characters 
43056,cinematic poem 
43057,boiling point 
43058,the rich performances by friel 
43059,a meatier deeper beginning andor ending would have easily tipped this film into the  a  range  as is  it s a very very strong  b    
43060,maddeningly insistent and repetitive 
43061,dream 
43062,unlikable  uninteresting  unfunny  
43063,everything kieslowski s work aspired to  including the condition of art 
43064,degrading and 
43065,it is supremely unfunny and unentertaining to watch middleage and older men drink to excess  piss on trees  bs one another and put on a show in drag  
43066,compelling story to tell 
43067,the film s intimate camera work and 
43068,a classic fairy tale that perfectly captures the wonders and worries of childhood in a way that few movies have ever approached 
43069,that it s more than a worthwhile effort 
43070,this quietly lyrical tale probes the ambiguous welcome extended by iran to the afghani refugees who streamed across its borders  desperate for work and food

43072,an excruciating demonstration of the unsalvageability 
43073,clearcut 
43074,be a breakthrough in filmmaking 
43075,succeeds as a powerful look at a failure of our justice system 
43076,beautiful 
43077,although the sequel has all the outward elements of the original  the first film s lovely flakiness is gone  replaced by the forced funniness found in the dullest kiddie flicks  
43078,each trailer park you drive past  even if it chiefly inspires you to drive a little faster 
43079,how bad it is 
43080,the film shatters you in waves  
43081,the movie s downfall 
43082,sometimes murky 
43083,the first question to ask about bad company is why anthony hopkins is in it  
43084,loud  chaotic and largely unfunny  
43085,inventive  fun  intoxicatingly sexy  violent  selfindulgent and maddening  
43086,the milieu is wholly unconvincing  and the histrionics reach a truly annoying pitch  
43087,add muchneeded levity 
43088,from any movie with a  2  
43089,another arnold vehicle that fails to make adequate 
43090,boasts enough funny dialogue and sharp 
43091,because of its heightened  wellshaped dramas  
43092,if it s unnerving suspense you re after  you ll find it with ring  an indisputably spooky film  with a screenplay to die for  
43093,called best bad film you thought was going to be really awful but 
43094,brilliant in this 
43095,its utterly misplaced earnestness 
43096,nonetheless it drags during its 112minute length

43100,holiday carol 
43101,some of the visual flourishes are a little too obvious  but restrained and subtle storytelling 
43102,never capitalizes on this concept and opts for the breezy and amateurish feel of an after school special on the subject of tolerance

43143,incredible storyline 
43144,the beauty 
43145,for the full 90 minutes  especially with the weak payoff 
43146,a perfect performance that captures the innocence and budding demons within a wallflower

43182,expect more from director michael apted  enigma  and screenwriter nicholas kazan  reversal of fortune  than this cliche pileup 
43183,uncomfortably timely  relevant  and sickeningly real 
43184,could have given audiences the time of day by concentrating on the elements of a revealing alienation among a culture of people who sadly are at hostile odds with one another through recklessness and retaliation  
43185,s an utterly static picture 
43186,hate it because it s lousy 
43187,this fascinating experiment plays as more of a poetic than a strict reality  creating an intriguing species of artifice that gives the lady and the duke something of a theatrical air

43210,improves upon the original hit movie 
43211,such good humor 
43212,an oddity  to be sure  but one that you might wind up remembering with a degree of affection rather than revulsion  
43213,demonstrates the unusual power of thoughtful  subjective filmmaking  
43214,is a truly  truly bad movie

43226,more simply intrusive 
43227,jawdropping action sequences

43252,comedian  like its subjects  delivers the goods and audiences will have a fun  nofrills ride  
43253,a smart  arch and rather coldblooded comedy 
43254,should catch this imax offering 
43255,it s a smart  funny look at an arcane area of popular culture  and if it is nt entirely persuasive  it does give exposure to some talented performers  
43256,is the first film in a long time that made me want to bolt the theater in the first 10 minutes  
43257,a lot of fun  with an undeniable energy 
43258,a beautiful paean to a time 
43259,the gifted crudup has the perfect face to play a handsome blank yearning to find himself 
43260,this is a very ambitious project for a fairly inexperienced filmmaker  but good actors  good poetry and good music help sustain it  
43261,bravery and dedication 
43262,visceral excitement 
43263,tartakovsky s team has some freakish powers of visual charm

43268,nothing distinguishing in a randall wallace film 
43269,julia roberts hands out awards  with phony humility barely camouflaging grotesque narcissism 
43270,but disintegrates into a dreary  humorless soap opera

43272,satisfies  as comfort food often can 
43273, captures a life interestingly lived 
43274,a literary detective story is still a detective story and aficionados of the whodunit wo nt be disappointed

43290,seems far more interested in grossout humor than in showing us wellthought stunts or a car chase that we have nt seen 10000 times 
43291,is structured less as a documentary and more as a found relic 
43292,the visceral excitement 
43293,suspenseful and ultimately unpredictable

43301,ca nt wait to see end  
43302,serry s ability to take what is essentially a contained family conflict and put it into a much larger historical context 
43303,worth a salute just for trying to be more complex than your average film  
43304,a powerful 1957 drama we ve somehow never seen before 
43305,s plenty to enjoy  
43306,it has fun with the quirks of family life  but it also treats the subject with fondness and respect 
43307,to show the gentle and humane side of middle eastern world politics 
43308,final verdict 
43309,allows us to be transported into the life of wladyslaw szpilman  who is not only a pianist  but a good human being

43314,there is no denying the power of polanski s film  
43315,video before month s end 
43316, its apparent glee is derived from a lobotomy  having had all its vital essence scooped out and discarded  
43317,that s suspenseful enough for older kids but not too scary for the schoolage crowd 
43318,chamber of secrets will find millions of eager fans  
43319,these components combine into one terrific story with lots of laughs  
43320,just too bad the screenwriters eventually shoot themselves in the feet with cop flick cliches like an oily arms dealer  squad car pileups and the requisite screaming captain 
43321,of animated filmmaking since old walt 
43322,to be prescribed than recommended  as visually bland as a dentist s waiting room  complete with soothing muzak and a cushion of predictable narrative rhythms 
43323,so it s not a brilliant piece of filmmaking

43365,better than the phantom menace 
43366,is definitely its screenplay  both for the rhapsodic dialogue that jumps off the page  and for the memorable character creations  
43367,demonstrates just how far his storytelling skills have eroded  
43368,be underestimated

43382,steven soderbergh does nt remake andrei tarkovsky s solaris so much as distill it  
43383,like coming into a longrunning  wellwritten television series where you ve missed the first halfdozen episodes and probably wo nt see the next six

43562,is so convincing that by movies  end you ll swear you are wet in some places and feel sand creeping in others 
43563,like the imaginary sport it projects onto the screen  loud  violent and mindless 
43564,yet unforgivingly inconsistent 
43565,wo nt have any trouble getting kids to eat up these veggies

43568,s all about anakin  and the lustrous polished visuals rich in color and creativity and  of course  special effect  
43569,affectionately 
43570,a great impression 
43571, the movie benefits from having a real writer plot out all of the characters  moves and overlapping story  
43572,it s hard to imagine anybody ever being  in the mood  to view a movie as harrowing and painful as the grey zone 
43573,a clumsily manufactured exploitation flick  
43574,farts  boobs 
43575,joyous documentary  
43576,crudely 
43577,another wholly unnecessary addition 
43578,want to see over and over again 
43579,a rather bland affair  
43580,of the nincompoop benigni persona 
43581,say that this vapid vehicle is downright doltish and uneventful 
43582,might just be better suited to a night in the living room than a night at the movies 
43583,a film about female friendship that men can embrace and women 
43584,finally succeeds in diminishing his stature from oscarwinning master to lowly studio hack  
43585,with pitifully few real laughs 
43586,one of those movies barely registering a blip on the radar screen of 2002 
43587,as faithful portraiture 
43588,according to the script  grant and bullock s characters are made for each other  
43589,one of the best ensemble casts of the year 
43590,is nicely shot  welledited and features a standout performance by diane lane 
43591,makes less sense than the bruckheimeresque american action flicks it emulates 
43592,is a loose collection of notsofunny gags  scattered moments of lazy humor 
43593,for those who like quirky  slightly strange french films  this is a must  
43594,runs 163 minutes 
43595,is devoid of wit and humor 
43596,that it s tempting just to go with it for the ride 
43597,it never lacks in eyepopping visuals 
43598,a serious minded patience  respect and affection 
43599,uncharismatically 
43600,that s suitable for all ages  a movie that will make you laugh 
43601,enjoyable ease 
43602,it s got the brawn  but not the brains  
43603,pretty good little movie  
43604,another classic 
43605,rehashes to feed to the younger generations 
43606,lack their idol s energy and passion for detail  
43607,one of this year s very best pictures 
43608,more confused  less interesting and more sloppily 
43609,defend himself 
43610,gets sillier  not scarier 
43611,can make interesting a subject you thought would leave you cold 
43612,does a good job of establishing a time and place  and of telling a fascinating character s story 
43613,its delivery is a complete mess 
43614,snide and 
43615,ache with sadness  the way chekhov is funny  
43616,a compassionate  moving portrait of an american  and an america  always reaching for something just outside his grasp 
43617,long workout

43627,telling 
43628,tattered and ugly past 
43629,a warm  fuzzy feeling prevails 
43630,the worst film of the year 
43631,brightly colored dreams 
43632,beautifully shaped 
43633,the holocaust escape story 
43634,humble 
43635,something to be said for a studioproduced film that never bothers to hand viewers a suitcase full of easy answers 
43636,but even while his characters are acting horribly  he is always sympathetic  
43637,in which most of the characters forget their lines 
43638,murphy and wilson actually make a pretty good team  
43639,as original and insightful 
43640,brings a beguiling freshness to a comingofage story with such a buoyant  expressive flow of images 
43641,one of the best of a growing strain of daring films  that argue that any sexual relationship that does nt hurt anyone and works for its participants is a relationship that is worthy of our respect 
43642,involving in its bold presentation 
43643,look like a masterpiece 
43644,an enthusiastic charm 
43645,but then again  i hate myself most mornings  
43646,jawdropping action sequences  striking villains  a gorgeous color palette  astounding technology  stirring music 
43647,astonishingly condescending attitude 
43648, it does nt even seem like she tried  
43649,shyamalan should stop trying to please his mom  
43650,demonstrate how desperate the makers of this  we re  doingitfor  thecash  sequel were  
43651,it s hard to shake the feeling that it was intended to be a different kind of film  
43652, do we have that same option to slap her creators because they re clueless and inept  
43653,encompasses many more paths 
43654,the movie is concocted and carried out by folks worthy of scorn  and the nicest thing i can say is that i ca nt remember a single name responsible for it  
43655,stylized humor throughout 
43656,re rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects  deaths just so the documentary will be over 
43657,is the equivalent of french hiphop  which also seems to play on a 10year delay  
43658,to work us over  with second helpings of love  romance  tragedy  false dawns  real dawns  comic relief  two separate crises during marriage ceremonies  and the lush scenery of the cotswolds 
43659,garcía bernal and talancón are an immensely appealing couple 
43660,traps audiences in a series of relentlessly nasty situations 
43661,i know that i ll never listen to marvin gaye or the supremes the same way again 
43662,not exaggerated enough to be a parody of grossout flicks  college flicks  or even flicks in general  
43663,you can enjoy much of jonah simply  and gratefully  as laughoutloud lunacy with a pronounced monty pythonesque flavor

43667, the power of this movie is undeniable  
43668,exceptional 
43669,its position 
43670,like shrek  spirit s visual imagination reminds you of why animation is such a perfect medium for children  because of the way it allows the mind to enter and accept another world  
43671,created a substantive movie out of several cliched movie structures  the road movie  the comingofage movie  and the teenage sex comedy  
43672,frothing 
43673,brilliant performances 
43674,the movie s messages are quite admirable 
43675,perfect family film 
43676,makes the formula fresh again 
43677,to forget that they are actually movie folk 
43678,gaping enough to pilot 
43679,are very expressive 
43680,beating the austin powers films at their own game 
43681,pokes  provokes 
43682,the procession 
43683,is the fact that there is nothing distinguishing in a randall wallace film  
43684,the needlessly poor quality of its archival prints and film footage 
43685,this movie may not have the highest production values you ve ever seen  but it s the work of an artist  one whose view of america  history and the awkwardness of human life is generous and deep 
43686, they ll probably run out screaming  
43687,sharply comic 
43688, tries

43696,to grow boring  which proves that rohmer still has a sense of his audience 
43697,halfway mark it takes an abrupt turn into glucose sentimentality and laughable contrivance  
43698,it s dark but has wonderfully funny moments  
43699,guns  violence 
43700,the silliness 
43701,a solid formula 
43702,entirely wholesome  
43703,most of the movie s success

43706,respects 
43707,trickery 
43708,managed to convey a tiny sense of hope 
43709,is surprisingly brilliant  deftly sewing together what could have been a confusing and horrifying vision into an intense and engrossing headtrip  
43710,alexandre dumas classic 
43711,is more likely to induce sleep than fright 
43712,a tragic love story 
43713,any more than the gorgeous piano and strings on the soundtrack can drown out the tinny selfrighteousness of his voice 
43714,focus  point and purpose

43716,mortal awareness 
43717,the new insomnia is a surprisingly faithful remake of its chilly predecessor  
43718,a pathetic  endearing hero 
43719,if allen  at 66  has stopped challenging himself 
43720,it is an uneven film for the most part 
43721,contrived pastiche of caper clichés  
43722,cold  gray  antiseptic and emotionally desiccated 
43723,seagal ran out of movies years ago  and 
43724,exudes the fizz of a busby berkeley musical and the visceral excitement of a sports extravaganza  
43725,lasker s canny  meditative script distances sex and love  as byron and luther 
43726,the really bad blair witch project 
43727,make such a worthless film 
43728,collapses 
43729,just another combination of bad animation and mindless violence  lacking the slightest bit 
43730,will be on video long before they grow up and you can wait till then  
43731,the movie attempts to mine laughs from a genre  the gangstercrime comedy  that wore out its welcome with audiences several years ago  and its cutesy reliance on moviespecific cliches is nt exactly endearing  
43732,twinkling 
43733,endorses 
43734,mired in a shabby script that piles layer upon layer of action man cliché atop wooden dialogue and a shifting tone that falls far short of the peculiarly moral amorality of  woo s  best work 
43735,you exit the theater 
43736,selfaware  often selfmocking  intelligence 
43737,creep the living hell out of you 
43738,like the guys

43740,the ridiculous dialog 
43741,is definitely a cut above the rest  
43742,boozy 
43743,there is nothing redeeming about this movie  
43744,be when he is not more lucratively engaged in the shameless selfcaricature of  analyze this   1999  and  analyze that   promised  or threatened  for later this year 
43745,brilliant and macabre 
43746,endearing and easy 
43747,a ponderous and pretentious endeavor that s unfocused and tediously exasperating 
43748,slapped together 
43749,a reminder of how they used to make movies  but also how they sometimes still can be made  
43750,sag in certain places 
43751,a thrill 
43752,deeply affecting film 
43753,no more racist portraits of indians  for instance

43771,ll find in this dreary mess 
43772,powerful and provocative 
43773,is a just a waste  
43774,is not really a film as much as it is a loose collection of notsofunny gags  scattered moments of lazy humor  
43775,that is even lazier and far less enjoyable  
43776,pleasant in spite of its predictability 
43777,she is a lioness  
43778,of some children who remain curious about each other against all odds 
43779,jostling against farce  thoughtful dialogue elbowed aside by oneliners  and a visual style that incorporates rotoscope animation for no apparent reason except  maybe  that it looks neat 
43780,aims to confuse 
43781,there are nt too many films that can be as simultaneously funny  offbeat and heartwarming  without a thick shmear of the goo  at least   but  elling  manages to do all three quite well  making it one of the year s most enjoyable releases 
43782,finds no way to entertain or inspire its viewers

44778,the new insomnia is a surprisingly faithful remake of its chilly predecessor  and 
44779,is a movie so insecure about its capacity to excite that it churns up not one but two flagrantly fake thunderstorms to underscore the action

45036,greatest mistake

45039,carl 
45040,the disappointingly generic nature of the entire effort

45055,done that  a thousand times already 
45056,no means a slamdunk and sure to ultimately disappoint the action fans who will be moved to the edge of their seats by the dynamic first act

45085,m not sure which is worse  the poor acting by the ensemble cast  the flat dialogue by vincent r nebrida or the gutless direction by laurice guillen

45288,a very slow  uneventful 
45289,fun and funky look

46791,the story simply putters along looking for astute observations and coming up blank  
46792,to be running on hypertime in reverse as the truly funny bits 
46793,begging for attention  giving audiences no reason to truly care for its decrepit freaks beyond the promise of a reprieve from their incessant whining 
46794,sometimes exceptional film 
46795,clarity and 
46796,mindless yet impressively lean spinoff of last summer s bloated effects fest the mummy returns  
46797,laughter and selfexploitation 
46798,mostly it s a work that  with humor  warmth  and intelligence  captures a life interestingly lived  
46799,a smart  provocative drama that does the nearly impossible  
46800,disintegrating bloodsucker computer effects and 
46801,exceptionally dreary and overwrought 
46802,a comingofage tale 
46803, vulgar is  truly and thankfully  a oneofakind work  
46804,maintains an appealing veneer 
46805,because the intelligence level of the characters must be low  very low  very very low  for the masquerade to work  the movie contains no wit  only labored gags  
46806,had just typed  chris rock    anthony hopkins  and  terrorists  into some univaclike script machine 
46807,interesting in unfaithful 
46808,is such a sweet and sexy film 
46809,probably one of the best since the last waltz 
46810,melds derivative elements into something that is often quite rich and exciting  and always a beauty to behold 
46811,the most opaque  selfindulgent and just plain goofy an excuse for a movie as you can imagine  
46812,it feels like a glossy rehash  
46813,exhibits the shallow sensationalism characteristic of soap opera  more salacious telenovela than serious drama 
46814,the movie ends with outtakes in which most of the characters forget their lines and just utter  uhhh   which is better than most of the writing in the movie  
46815,refried green tomatoes 
46816,keep the story compelling 
46817,feeling this movie 
46818,overexposed waste 
46819,demonstrating vividly that the beauty and power of the opera reside primarily in the music itself 
46820,is to sit through about 90 minutes of a socalled  comedy  and not laugh once 
46821,far more stylish and 
46822,s always fascinating to watch marker the essayist at work  
46823,while it s all quite tasteful to look at  the attention process tends to do a little fleeing of its own  
46824, unimaginative and derivative 
46825,most disappointing woody allen movie 
46826,a poignant comedy that offers food for 
46827,is like binging on cotton candy 
46828,s depressing to see how far herzog has fallen 
46829,to the filmmakers  ivan is a prince of a fellow  but he comes across as shallow and glib though not meanspirited  and there s no indication that he s been responsible for putting together any movies of particular value or merit  
46830,milder is nt better 
46831,they could nt have done in half an hour 
46832,exploiting it yourself

46835,leave you wanting more  
46836,moaning about their cruel fate 
46837,melancholy 
46838,there is almost nothing in this flat effort that will amuse or entertain them  either  
46839,stale and 
46840,sorority boys is a bowser  
46841,there s undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references  but the fun wears thin  then out  when there s nothing else happening 
46842,the plot is paperthin and the characters are nt interesting enough to watch them go about their daily activities for two whole hours  
46843,would not improve much after a therapeutic zap of shock treatment 
46844,violated 
46845,the courage of its convictions and excellent performances on its side 
46846,stirs us as well 
46847,smothered in the excesses of writerdirector roger avary 
46848,the pretensions  and disposable story  sink the movie  
46849,born out of an engaging storyline  which also is nt embarrassed to make you reach for the tissues 
46850,de niro s righthand goombah 
46851,right choice 
46852,are remarkable 
46853,marshall keeps the energy humming  
46854,bad bear suits 
46855,to whet one s appetite for the bollywood films 
46856,come from philippe  who makes oliver far more interesting than the character s lines would suggest  and sarandon  who could nt be better as a cruel but weirdly likable wasp matron  
46857,there s some good material in their story about a retail clerk wanting more out of life  but the movie too often spins its wheels with familiar situations and repetitive scenes 
46858,the three leads produce adequate performances  but what s missing from this material is any depth of feeling 
46859,seriously  folks  it does nt work  
46860,stunning technical achievement 
46861,it plods along methodically  somehow under the assumption that its  dead wife communicating from beyond the grave  framework is even remotely new or interesting  
46862,the brim with ideas 
46863,iles 
46864,some charm and heart 
46865,there are flaws  but also stretches of impact and moments of awe  we re wrapped up in the characters  how they make their choices  and why 
46866,contrived plot points 
46867,awakening and 
46868, mr schnitzler proves himself a deft pace master and stylist

46870,is too busy hitting all of its assigned marks to take on any life of its own 
46871,a strength 
46872,that appeals to me 
46873,naive dreams 
46874,a better celebration of these unfairly dismissed heroes would be a film that is nt this painfully forced  false and fabricated  
46875,about an adult male dressed in pink jammies 
46876, laissezpasser has all the earmarks of french cinema at its best  
46877,shorter than the first  as best i remember   but still a very good time at the cinema 
46878,though harris is affecting at times  he can not overcome the sense that pumpkin is a mere plot pawn for two directors with far less endearing disabilities  
46879,little wit 
46880, his secret life will leave you thinking 
46881,the stillinestimable contribution they have made to our shared history 
46882,at its laziest 
46883,its worst harangues 
46884,miracles  
46885,a dull  simpleminded and stereotypical tale of drugs  death and mindnumbing indifference on the innercity streets  
46886,nothing short of refreshing 
46887,there s nothing remotely topical or sexy here  
46888,be about everything that s plaguing the human spirit in a relentlessly globalizing world 
46889,see all summer 
46890,as scaryfunny as tremors 
46891,a captivatingly quirky hybrid 
46892,a wonderful film to bring to imax 
46893,an intelligently made  and beautifully edited  picture that at the very least has a spark of life to it  more than you can say for plenty of movies that flow through the hollywood pipeline without a hitch  
46894,both a detective story and a romance spiced with the intrigue of academic skullduggery and politics  
46895,gibberish 
46896,you find comfort in familiarity 
46897,rises above the level of a telanovela  
46898,naqoyqatsi  is banal in its message and the choice of material to convey it  
46899, however entertainingly presented  
46900,a sour attempt

46905,loved classic 
46906,transformed star 
46907,employs an accent that i think is supposed to be an attempt at hardass american but sometimes just lapses into unhidden british  
46908,from a sharper  cleaner script 
46909,find it baffling 
46910,by now intolerable morbidity 
46911,of a director enjoying himself immensely 
46912,in a dysfunctional family 
46913,shreve s graceful dual narrative gets clunky on the screen  
46914,feels like the work of an artist who is simply tired  of fighting the same fights  of putting the weight of the world on his shoulders  of playing with narrative form  
46915,farts  urine  
46916,the lousy john q all but spits out denzel washington s fine performance in the title role  
46917,unexpected  and often contradictory  truths emerge

46924,talented performers 
46925,does nt make sense 
46926,some unnecessary parts 
46927,is just too easy to be genuinely satisfying  
46928,would be a film that is nt this painfully forced  false and fabricated 
46929,the slightest difficulty accepting him in the role 
46930,hooks us 
46931, nicholas nickleby is too much like a fragment of an underdone potato  
46932,more accurate than anything 
46933,has the courage of its convictions and excellent performances on its side 
46934,no organic intrigue 
46935,tardier 
46936,short and sweet  but also more than anything else slight  tadpole pulls back from the consequences of its own actions and revelations  
46937,grab you 
46938,of entertainment that parents love to have their kids 
46939,slight and uninventive 
46940,ll stay with the stage versions  however  which bite cleaner  and deeper 
46941,hedonistic creativity 
46942,benefit enormously 
46943, i hate it  
46944,high crimes is a cinematic misdemeanor 
46945,the performances are worthwhile  
46946,kwan is a master of shadow  quietude  and room noise  and lan yu is a disarmingly livedin movie 
46947,unsurprisingly 
46948,see this turd squashed under a truck  preferably a semi 
46949,irritating  at least to this western ear   
46950,try to create characters out of the obvious cliches  but wind up using them as punching bags  
46951,ripe recipe  inspiring 
46952,there  done that  a thousand times already  and better 
46953,the pantheon of the best of the swashbucklers 
46954,visual splendor that can be seen in other films 
46955,the densest distillation of roberts  movies ever made  
46956,love it  hell  i dunno  
46957,that make the most of the largescreen format  before swooping down on a string of exotic locales  scooping the whole world up in a joyous communal festival of rhythm 
46958,insightful enough to be fondly remembered in the endlessly challenging maze of moviegoing 
46959,solid  satisfying fare for adults 
46960,is awe and affection  and a strange urge to get on a board and  uh  shred  dude  
46961,a wish your heart makes 
46962,totalitarian 
46963,in a shabby script 
46964,of abuse 
46965,renner carries much of the film with a creepy and deadon performance  
46966,a seriously bad film with seriously warped logic by writerdirector kurt wimmer at the screenplay level  
46967,are complex and quirky  but entirely believable as the remarkable ensemble cast brings them to life  
46968,its weighty themes are too grave for youngsters  
46969,reggio and glass so rhapsodize cynicism  with repetition and languorous slomo sequences  that glass s dirgelike score becomes a fangbaring lullaby  
46970,lies  footage that might have made no such thing a trenchant  ironic cultural satire instead of a frustrating misfire 
46971,probably the best case for christianity since chesterton and lewis 
46972,stifling morality tale 
46973,been slimed in the name of high art 
46974,it happens to flat characters 
46975,the ridiculous dialog or the ohso convenient plot twists

46979,it s still a good yarn  which is nothing to sneeze at these days  
46980,interesting storytelling devices 
46981,much to it 
46982,cliche pileup 
46983,coming from a director beginning to resemble someone s crazy french grandfather 
46984,the updated dickensian sensibility of writer craig bartlett s story 
46985,is left with a sour taste in one s mouth  and little else 
46986,trapped presents a frightening and compelling  what if   
46987,a dumb  fun  curiously adolescent movie this 
46988,its originality 
46989,realize that deep inside righteousness can be found a tough beauty 
46990,spy kids 2 also happens to be that rarity among sequels  it actually improves upon the original hit movie 
46991,you can taste it  but there s no fizz  
46992,not all of the stories work and the ones that do are thin and scattered  but the film works well enough to make it worth watching  
46993,patent solutions to dramatize life s messiness from inside out  in all its strange quirks 
46994,the movie is widely seen and debated with appropriate ferocity and thoughtfulness 
46995,is something of a triumph 
46996,is surprisingly brilliant  deftly sewing together what could have been a confusing and horrifying vision into an intense and engrossing headtrip 
46997,lisa rinzler s cinematography may be lovely  
46998,who s seen george roy hill s 1973 film   the sting 
46999,a half dozen 
47000,expect no major discoveries  nor any stylish sizzle  but the film sits with square conviction and touching good sense on the experience of its women 
47001,thanks to kline s superbly nuanced performance  that pondering 
47002,abridged edition 
47003,your entertainment standards 
47004,finds amusing juxtapositions that justify his exercise 
47005,of genuine insight into the urban heart 
47006,the film is impressive for the sights and sounds of the wondrous beats the world has to offer  
47007,is a fascinating little tale 
47008,anyone managing to steal a movie not only from charismatic rising star jake gyllenhaal but also from accomplished oscar winners susan sarandon  dustin hoffman and holly hunter  yet newcomer ellen pompeo pulls off the feat with aplomb 
47009,doze off for a few minutes 
47010,good news to anyone 
47011,murder by numbers just does nt add up  
47012,as delicately calibrated in tone 
47013,the bullseye 
47014,is a diverting  if predictable  adventure suitable for a matinee  with a message that cautions children about disturbing the world s delicate ecological balance  
47015,may be captivated  as i was  by its moods  and by its subtly transformed star  and still wonder why paul thomas anderson ever had the inclination to make the most sincere and artful movie in which adam sandler will probably ever appear  
47016,its real emotional business 
47017,dull effects 
47018,washington demands and receives excellent performances 
47019,the whole movie is simply a lazy exercise in bad filmmaking that asks you to not only suspend your disbelief but your intelligence as well  
47020,humor and lightness 
47021,provide an emotional edge 
47022, the director uses the last act to reel in the audience since its poignancy hooks us completely  
47023,find a movie character more unattractive or odorous  than leon  
47024,s not a bad premise  just a bad movie  
47025,in entertaining 
47026,a captivatingly quirky hybrid of character portrait  romantic comedy and beattheclock thriller  
47027,can tell you that there s no other reason why anyone should bother remembering it  
47028,its gentle  touching story 
47029,assume that the jury who bestowed star hoffman s brother gordy with the waldo salt screenwriting award at 2002 s sundance festival were honoring an attempt to do something different over actually pulling it off 
47030,sweet spirit 
47031,where the characters  moves are often more predictable than their consequences 
47032,is just lazy writing 
47033,an entirely stale concept 
47034,a selfreflexive  philosophical nature 
47035,the outstanding soundtrack 
47036,sharp script 
47037,has been trying to pass off as acceptable teen entertainment for some time now  
47038,particularly funny

47055,is hard to dismiss  moody  thoughtful  and 
47056,cheap  
47057,a thing to do with these characters except have them run through dark tunnels  fight off various anonymous attackers  and evade elaborate surveillance technologies 
47058,is a hoot  and 
47059,be called the best korean film of 2002 
47060,to match the ordeal of sitting through it 
47061,grossly 
47062,is haunting   it s  what punk rock music used to be  and what the video medium could use more of  spirit  perception  conviction  
47063,to inspire anything more than a visit to mcdonald s  let alone some savvy street activism 
47064,the dull effects 
47065,too many scenes toward the end that should move quickly 
47066,has rewards 
47067,be a movie that ends up slapping its target audience in the face by shooting itself in the foot 
47068,created a film that one can honestly describe as looking  sounding and simply feeling like no other film in recent history 
47069,there is nt one moment in the film that surprises or delights  
47070,fascinating connections 
47071,not quite as miraculous as its dreamworks makers would have you believe 
47072,time out 
47073,that the answer is as conventional as can be 
47074,foulnatured 
47075,an almost unbearably morbid

47087,puts a refreshing and comical spin on the alltoofamiliar saga of the contemporary single woman  
47088,wellcharacterized 
47089,this strenuously unfunny showtime deserves the hook  
47090,a pleasure to watch 
47091,more than a few moments that are insightful enough to be fondly remembered in the endlessly challenging maze of moviegoing 
47092,the one thing that holds interest in the midst of a mushy  existential exploration of why men leave their families

48185,emotional edge 
48186,one of the better videogamebased flicks  is that the film acknowledges upfront that the plot makes no sense  such that the lack of linearity is the point of emotional and moral departure for protagonist alice

48612,unblinkingly pure as the hours 
48613,feels stitched together from stock situations and characters from other movies

48653,come away from his film overwhelmed  
48654,the determination of pinochet s victims to seek justice  and their often heartbreaking testimony  spoken directly into director patricio guzman s camera  pack a powerful emotional wallop  
48655,he nonetheless appreciates the art and reveals a music scene that transcends culture and race  
48656,combines sharp comedy  oldfashioned monster movie atmospherics  and genuine heart to create a film that s not merely about kicking undead   but also about dealing with regret and  ultimately  finding redemption

48950,the titillating material 
48951,infidelity 
48952,enjoyably 
48953,no good answer to that one 
48954,be a somewhat backhanded compliment to say that the film makes the viewer feel like the movie s various victimized audience members after a while  but it also happens to be the movie s most admirable quality 
48955,s pure entertainment 
48956,to pop up in a cinematic year already littered with celluloid garbage 
48957,grows decidedly flimsier with its many outsized  out of character and logically porous action set pieces  
48958,is an encyclopedia of cliches that shoplifts shamelessly from farewelltoinnocence movies like the wanderers and a bronx tale without cribbing any of their intelligence 
48959,though jones and snipes are enthralling  the movie bogs down in rhetoric and cliché

48977,finds the ideal outlet for his flickknife diction in the role of roger swanson  
48978,of the worst sin of attributable to a movie like this 
48979,the whole thing succeeded only in making me groggy  
48980,cobbled together from largely flat and uncreative moments 
48981,a weird  arresting little ride  
48982,much more than 
48983,really goes downhill

48994,an unforgettable look at morality  family  and social expectation through the prism of that omnibus tradition called marriage  
48995,the characters are complex  laden with plenty of baggage and tinged with tragic undertones 
48996,will undoubtedly play well in european markets  where mr besson is a brand name  and in asia  where ms shu is an institution  but american audiences will probably find it familiar and insufficiently cathartic 
48997,ultimately purposeless 
48998,occasionally loud and offensive  but more often  it simply lulls you into a gentle waking coma  
48999,more intimate than spectacular  et is carried less by wow factors than by its funny  moving yarn that holds up well after two decades  
49000,one of the funniest motion 
49001,remake andrei tarkovsky s solaris so much as distill it 
49002,as unblinkingly pure as the hours

49030,that is actually funny with the material 
49031,narrative continuity 
49032,contains a few big laughs but many more that graze the funny bone or miss it altogether  in part because the consciously dumbeddown approach wears thin

49052,very good film 
49053,more curious 
49054,liked it because it was so endlessly  grotesquely  inventive

49961,of disney s great past 
49962,painfully flat grossout comedy 
49963,take care is nicely performed by a quintet of actresses  but nonetheless it drags during its 112minute length  
49964,a lumbering load of hokum but 
49965,that virtually no one is bound to show up at theaters for it 
49966,all the boozy selfindulgence that brings out the worst in otherwise talented actors 
49967,the film is funny  insightfully human and a delightful lark for history buffs

49971,this kiddieoriented stinker

49988,meager 
49989,about guys and dolls 
49990,so awful 
49991,s hard to believe that something so short could be so flabby

50012,the wasted potential of this slapstick comedy 
50013,that its own action is nt very effective 
50014, noisy and pretentious 
50015,a genuinely bonechilling tale 
50016,one the public

50033,some laughs 
50034,see this terrific film 
50035,an oddity  to be sure  but one that you might wind up remembering with a degree of affection rather than revulsion 
50036,too amateurish and awkward 
50037,although the film boils down to a lightweight story about matchmaking  the characters make italian for beginners worth the journey 
50038,for leonard 
50039,clichés  depression and 
50040,an unsympathetic hero caught up in an intricate plot that while cleverly worked out  can not overcome blah characters

50045,waldo salt screenwriting award 
50046,no 1

50054,with table manners 
50055,illuminating 
50056,with a clever pseudobio that manages to have a good time as it doles out pieces of the famous director s life

50058,remarkably insightful 
50059,actually happened as if it were the third ending of clue

50064,parents may even find that it goes by quickly  because it has some of the funniest jokes of any movie this year  including those intended for adults  
50065,shot in rich  shadowy blackandwhite  devils chronicles  with increasingly amused irony  the relationship between reluctant captors and befuddled captives  
50066,this is one of the biggest disappointments of the year

50086,the stars may be college kids  but the subject matter is as adult as you can get 
50087,a sense of real magic  perhaps 
50088,is only so much baked cardboard i need to chew  
50089, johnnie to and wai ka fai are  sure to find an enthusiastic audience among american actionadventure buffs  but the film s interests may be too narrow to attract crossover viewers  
50090,was longer than an hour 
50091,the problem with all of this 
50092,suitably kooky which should appeal to women 
50093,a hard look at one man s occupational angst and its subsequent reinvention  a terrifying study of bourgeois desperation worthy of claude chabrol  
50094,a zingerfilled crowdpleaser that openminded elvis fans  but by no means all  will have fun with

50116,as a soufflé gone wrong 
50117,spout hilarious dialogue about following your dream and  just letting the mountain tell you what to do

50125,right down the reality drain 
50126,by a legacy of abuse 
50127,like locusts in a horde these things will keep coming

50130,makes for a touching love story 
50131,makes its message resonate 
50132,some movies were made for the big screen  some for the small screen  and some  like ballistic  ecks vs sever  were made for the palm screen  
50133,tully is in many ways the perfect festival film  a calm  selfassured portrait of small town regret  love  duty and friendship that appeals to the storytelling instincts of a slightly more literate filmgoing audience  
50134,got the wildly popular vin diesel in the equation 
50135,made a movie that is nt just offensive 
50136,leave us stranded with nothing more than our lesser appetites 
50137,the courage of new york s finest and a nicely understated expression of the grief 
50138,to hurry up and get to its subjects  deaths just so the documentary will be over

50196,in narc  they find new routes through a familiar neighborhood 
50197,the film is really closer to porn than a serious critique of what s wrong with this increasingly pervasive aspect of gay culture  
50198,is just as obvious as telling a country skunk that he has severe body odor 
50199,less like a cousin to blade runner than like a bottomfeeder sequel in the escape from new york series

50377,a goodnatured ensemble comedy 
50378,it s the element of condescension  as the filmmakers look down on their workingclass subjects from their lofty perch  that finally makes sex with strangers  which opens today in the new york metropolitan area  so distasteful  
50379,damned compelling 
50380,a star  nor why he keeps being cast in action films when none of them are ever any good

50651,will no doubt rally to its cause  trotting out threadbare standbys like  masterpiece  and  triumph  and all that malarkey  but rarely does an established filmmaker so ardently waste viewers  time with a gobbler like this  
50652,spectacular 
50653,even as it pays earnest homage to turntablists and beat jugglers  old schoolers and current innovators 
50654,the rerelease of ron howard s apollo 13 in the imax format proves absolutely that really  really  really good things can come in enormous packages  
50655,how resolutely unamusing  how thoroughly unrewarding all of this is  and 
50656,the chateau has one very funny joke and a few other decent ones  but all it amounts to is a mildly funny  sometimes tedious  ultimately insignificant film  
50657,most of the problems with the film 
50658,it s surprisingly decent  particularly for a tenth installment in a series  
50659,like getting all excited about a chocolate eclair and then biting into it and finding the filling missing 
50660,wit and hoopla 
50661,without much of a story

50663,presents yet another tired old vision of the gay community as an allinclusive world where uptight  middle class bores like antonia can feel good about themselves 
50664,is all but washed away by sumptuous ocean visuals and the cinematic stylings of director john stockwell  
50665,true and heartbreaking 
50666, like bartleby  is something of a stiff  an extradry office comedy that seems twice as long as its 83 minutes  
50667,lifts the film high above runofthefilth gangster flicks 
50668,than anything that s been done before 
50669,is nt a disaster  exactly  but a very handsomely produced letdown 
50670,provides a satisfyingly unsettling ride into the dark places of our national psyche  
50671,unbearable 
50672,lacking in chills 
50673,a lowkey labor of love that strikes a very resonant chord  
50674,the solid filmmaking and convincing characters 
50675,is the kind of movie where people who have never picked a lock do so easily after a few tries and become expert fighters after a few weeks  
50676,practically assures that the pocket monster movie franchise is nearly ready to keel over 
50677,a calculating fiend 
50678,wickedly funny  visually engrossing 
50679,if you really want to understand what this story is really all about  you re far better served by the source material  
50680, other than the very sluggish pace  
50681,failing to compensate for the paperthin characterizations and facile situations 
50682,ends with outtakes in which most of the characters forget their lines and just utter  uhhh   which is better than most of the writing in the movie 
50683, fatal script error 
50684,the director s epitaph for himself 
50685,the rich and sudden wisdom  the film 
50686,a war tribute

50703,the story is too steeped in fairy tales and other childish things to appeal much to teenagers 
50704,too sappy 
50705,often hilarious 
50706,seems just as expectant of an adoring  widesmiling reception  
50707,why paul thomas anderson ever had the inclination to make the most sincere and artful movie in which adam sandler will probably ever appear

50733,still manages to string together enough charming moments to work  
50734, stuart little 2 manages sweetness largely without stickiness

51153,nonsensical and formulaic 
51154,astonishingly pivotal 
51155,firstclass  natural acting 
51156,s far too tragic 
51157,be moved by this drama 
51158,it concentrates far too much on the awkward interplay and utter lack of chemistry between chan and hewitt  
51159,should be interesting 
51160,a guiltless film for nice evening out  
51161,unfolds predictably 
51162,like it was worth your seven bucks  
51163,is meaningless  vapid and devoid of substance 
51164,sight gags 
51165,a pleasant distraction  a friday night diversion  an excuse to eat popcorn 
51166,each one of these people stand out and 
51167,fine music 
51168,one of the greatest date movies in years 
51169,ponderous  plodding soap opera disguised as a feature film 
51170,triple x is a double agent  and he s one bad dude  
51171,this did nt connect with me would require another viewing 
51172,eerily suspenseful 
51173,is suitable summer entertainment that offers escapism without requiring a great deal of thought 
51174, but it s great cinematic polemic

51176,the incredible imax sound system 
51177, flat dialogue 
51178,moments of spontaneous creativity and authentic cooperative interaction

51182,offers a cleareyed chronicle of a female friendship that is more complex and honest than anything represented in a hollywood film 
51183,a naturally funny film 
51184,millions of eager fans 
51185,callow 
51186, contains very few laughs and even less surprises  
51187,it makes me wonder if lawrence hates criticism so much that he refuses to evaluate his own work  
51188,a delightful entree in the tradition of food movies 
51189,itself is just sooooo tired  
51190,a powerful  chilling  and affecting study 
51191,howard and his costars all give committed performances 
51192,sad  occasionally horrifying but often inspiring film 
51193,promises offers an unexpected window into the complexities of the middle east struggle and into the humanity of its people

51197,the plot grows thin soon 
51198,his own preoccupations and obsessions 
51199,heroic 
51200, unfaithful is at once intimate and universal cinema  
51201,is a vh1 behind the music special that has something a little more special behind it  music that did nt sell many records but helped change a nation  
51202,just about more stately than any contemporary movie this year  a true study  a film with a questioning heart and 
51203,give a taste of the burning man ethos  an appealing blend of countercultural idealism and hedonistic creativity 
51204,it does sustain an enjoyable level of ridiculousness 
51205,there is a certain sense of experimentation and improvisation to this film that may not always work  but it is nevertheless compelling  
51206,deep or 
51207,lacking any sense of commitment 
51208, the more outrageous bits achieve a shockyouintolaughter intensity of almost dadaist proportions  
51209,rigid and

51215,and  in the end  not well enough 
51216,grant is certainly amusing  but the very hollowness of the character he plays keeps him at arms length 
51217,is the case of a pregnant premise being wasted by a script that takes few chances and manages to insult the intelligence of everyone in the audience 
51218,although this idea is  new  
51219,a way of gently swaying back and forth as it cradles its characters  veiling tension beneath otherwise tender movements 
51220,falling into the hollywood trap and 
51221,can be expected from a college comedy that s target audience has nt graduated from junior high school 
51222, only with muscles and a lot more smarts  but just as endearing and easy to watch 
51223,curiously  super troopers suffers because it does nt have enough vices to merit its 103minute length

51227,that trademark grin of his 
51228,the group s playful spark

51239,once playful and haunting  an indepth portrait of an iconoclastic artist who was fundamentally unknowable even to his closest friends 
51240,has all the wiggling energy of young kitten 
51241,is a perfect family film to take everyone to since there s no new  a christmas carol  out in the theaters this year 
51242,comes along to remind us of how very bad a motion picture can truly be 
51243,sticks with its subjects a little longer 
51244,nicholson s understated performance is wonderful  
51245,even fans of sandler s comic taste may find it uninteresting 
51246,terry is a sort of geriatric dirty harry  which will please eastwood s loyal fans  and suits the story  wherein our hero must ride roughshod over incompetent cops to get his man  
51247,no such thing is hartley s least accessible screed yet  
51248,for happiness 
51249,reworking to aim the film at young males in the throes of their first full flush of testosterone

51252,an intelligent romantic thriller 
51253,of anyone who has reached puberty actually finding the characters in slackers or their antics amusing  let alone funny 
51254,looked as beautiful  desirable  even delectable  
51255,if the film has a problem  its shortness disappoints  you want the story to go on and on  
51256,a filmmaking methodology that s just experimental enough to alienate the mainstream audience while ringing cliched to hardened indieheads 
51257,a penetrating  potent exploration 
51258,is a gorgeous and deceptively minimalist cinematic tone poem  
51259,offering fine acting moments

51283,absolutely  inescapably gorgeous  
51284,its subject matter is too calm and thoughtful for agitprop  and the thinness of its characterizations makes it a failure as straight drama   
51285,it s difficult to feel anything much while watching this movie  beyond mild disturbance or detached pleasure at the acting  
51286,humorously 
51287,looks like the sixtime winner of the miss hawaiian tropic pageant  so i do nt know what she s doing in here

51310,the movie would seem less of a trifle if ms sugarman followed through on her defiance of the saccharine  
51311,dylan kidd 
51312,is felt  not the craven of  a nightmare on elm street  or  the hills have eyes   but the sad schlock merchant of  deadly friend

51323,fincher takes no apparent joy in making movies  
51324,reveals the ways in which a sultry evening or a beerfueled afternoon in the sun can inspire even the most retiring heart to venture forth 
51325,is nt as compelling or as believable as it should be  
51326,a female friendship that is more complex and honest than anything represented in a hollywood film 
51327,has all the heart of a porno flick  but none of the sheer lust   
51328,mushy 
51329,forced drama in this wildly uneven movie  about a young man s battle with his inescapable past and uncertain future in a very shapable but largely unfulfilling present 
51330,flawless amounts of acting  direction  story and pace 
51331,the fascination comes in the power of the huston performance  which seems so larger than life and yet so fragile 
51332,they go to a pictureperfect beach during sunset  
51333,s hard to stop watching 
51334,is an undeniably intriguing film from an adventurous young talent who finds his inspiration on the fringes of the american underground 
51335,despite an impressive roster of stars and direction from kathryn bigelow  the weight of water is oppressively heavy  
51336,followers of the whole deadundead genre  who deserve more from a vampire pic than a few shrieky special effects

51342,s a hellish  
51343,a group of more selfabsorbed women than the mother and daughters featured in this film 
51344,too much resonance 
51345,he allows a gawky actor like spall  who could too easily become comic relief in any other film  to reveal his impressively delicate range  
51346,even after the most awful acts are committed  is an overwhelming sadness that feels as if it has made its way into your very bloodstream  
51347,find their humorseeking dollars best spent elsewhere 
51348,lost his touch  
51349,like the rugrats movies  the wild thornberrys movie does nt offer much more than the series 
51350,to be the best espionage picture to come out in weeks 
51351,in the pants

51358,nicely shot 
51359,excruciatingly unfunny 
51360,complex from the start  and  refreshingly  stays that way 
51361,bad animation and 
51362,the director  mark pellington  does a terrific job conjuring up a sinister  menacing atmosphere though unfortunately all the story gives us is flashing red lights  a rattling noise  and a bump on the head

51367,the feeble examples 
51368,shyamalan s gifts 
51369,the narrator and the other characters try to convince us that acting transfigures esther  but she s never seen speaking on stage 
51370,inquisitive 
51371,from an eccentric and goodnaturedly aimless story 
51372,it does nt really know or care about the characters  and uses them as markers for a series of preordained events  
51373,cerebral and cinemantic flair 
51374,is every bit as fascinating 
51375,in frustration 
51376,childhood innocence combined with indoctrinated prejudice 
51377,is as serious as a pink slip  
51378,see samira makhmalbaf as a very distinctive sensibility  working to develop her own film language with conspicuous success 
51379,went over my head or  considering just 
51380,outtakes in which most of the characters forget their lines and just utter  uhhh   which is better than most of the writing in the movie 
51381,return to never land is reliable 
51382,boring man 
51383,mike leigh populates his movie with a wonderful ensemble cast of characters that bring the routine day to day struggles of the working class to life 
51384,to admire  the intensity with which he s willing to express his convictions 
51385,avoids all the comic possibilities of its situation  and becomes one more dumb high school comedy about sex gags and prom dates  
51386,experience that finds warmth in the coldest environment and makes each crumb of emotional comfort 
51387,it is welcome to see a chinese film depict a homosexual relationship in a mature and frank fashion 
51388,kinnear  gives his best screen performance with an oddly winning portrayal of one of life s ultimate losers  
51389,is frustratingly unconvincing  
51390, those farts got to my inner nineyearold 
51391,better vehicle 
51392,works well enough 
51393,from being dragged through a sad  sordid universe of guns  drugs  avarice and damaged dreams 
51394,while the production details are lavish  film has little insight into the historical period and its artists  particularly in how sand developed a notorious reputation  
51395,a guy who has waited three years with breathless anticipation for a new hal hartley movie to pore over 
51396,for frequently pandering to fans of the grossout comedy 
51397,one of the most incoherent features in recent memory

51410,comprehend it 
51411,the best movies 
51412,the direction has a fluid  nononsense authority  and the performances by harris  phifer and cam  ron seal the deal 
51413,is a canny crowd pleaser  and the last kiss  provides more than enough sentimental catharsis for a satisfying evening at the multiplex  
51414,the country bears  should never have been brought out of hibernation

51444,to check this one out 
51445,beautiful to watch and holds a certain charm  
51446,stuffy  
51447,worthless  from its pseudorockvideo opening 
51448,into a cheap thriller  a dumb comedy or a sappy 
51449,at once visceral and spiritual  wonderfully vulgar 
51450, it simply lulls you into a gentle waking coma

51456,the problem with  xxx  is that its own action is nt very effective  
51457, it looks good  sonny  but you missed the point   
51458,a powerful and telling story that examines forbidden love  racial tension  and other issues that are as valid today as they were in the 1950s 
51459,of the darkest variety 
51460, it s just another sports dramacharacter study

52354,for most movies  84 minutes is short  but this one feels like a life sentence  
52355,an incoherent jumble of a film that s rarely as entertaining as it could have been  
52356,the  true story  by which all the queen s men is allegedly  inspired  was a lot funnier and more deftly enacted than what s been cobbled together onscreen 
52357,without sham the rawnerved story

52417,a sleeper success 
52418,the worst movie

52432,what an idea 
52433,is without doubt an artist of uncompromising vision  but that vision is beginning to feel  
52434,the most repugnant adaptation of a classic text since roland joffé and demi moore s the scarlet letter

52437,loathsome movie 
52438,snowandstuntwork extravaganza 
52439,the yaya sisterhood

52441,looking over the outdated clothes and plastic knickknacks at your neighbor s garage sale

52455,of the world s best actors  daniel auteuil  
52456,appears to have been modeled on the worst revengeofthenerds clichés the filmmakers could dredge up  
52457,pretty decent little documentary 
52458,often it s meandering  low on energy  and too eager to be quirky at moments when a little oldfashioned storytelling would come in handy

52508,sending the audience 
52509,with energy  intelligence and verve  enhanced by a surplus of vintage archive footage 
52510,call me a cynic  but there s something awfully deadly about any movie with a lifeaffirming message  
52511,might just be the biggest husbandandwife disaster since john 
52512,works because of the universal themes  earnest performances  and excellent use of music by india s popular gulzar and jagjit singh

52519,this unimaginative comedian 
52520,septic 
52521,a keep  em  guessing plot and an affectionate take on its screwedup characters

52523,directed not only one of the best gay love stories ever made 
52524,lets things peter out midway 
52525,as a serious drama about spousal abuse 
52526,most audacious  outrageous 
52527,to the perkiness of witherspoon  who is always a joy to watch  even when her material is not firstrate  
52528, we have absolutely no idea who the main characters are until the film is well under way  and yet it s hard to stop watching  
52529,this genderbending comedy is generally quite funny  
52530,is a sweet and modest and ultimately winning story  
52531,accumulate like lint in a fat man s navel 
52532,never inspires more than an interested detachment  
52533,the wanton slipperiness of  corpus and its amiable jerking and reshaping of physical time and space would make it a great piece to watch with kids and use to introduce video as art

52564,there is something in full frontal  i guess  about artifice and acting and how it distorts reality for people who make movies and watch them  but 
52565,familiar but utterly delightful  
52566,cuba gooding jr valiantly mugs his way through snow dogs  but even his boisterous energy fails to spark this leaden comedy 
52567,veiling tension beneath otherwise tender movements 
52568,there are some laughs in this movie

52591,created a provocative 
52592,of cinematic perfection 
52593,it s not nearly as fresh or enjoyable as its predecessor  but there are enough high points to keep this from being a complete waste of time

52607,the better of obnoxious adults 
52608,a vastly improved germanic version of my big fat greek wedding 
52609, their struggle is simply too ludicrous and borderline insulting  
52610,smarter and more diabolical 
52611,this is rote spookiness  with nary an original idea  or role  or edit  or score  or anything  really  in sight  and the whole of the proceedings beg the question  why

52623,a chocolate 
52624,stroked  luridly colored  unidimensional nonsense machine that strokes the eyeballs while it evaporates like so much crypt mist in the brain 
52625,whose valuable messages are forgotten 10 minutes after the last trombone

52633,the fun of the movie is the chance it affords to watch jackson  who also served as executive producer  take his smooth  shrewd  powerful act abroad  
52634,is a matter of plumbing arrangements and mind games  of no erotic or sensuous charge  
52635,it goes nowhere 
52636,under our skin

52643,that it jams too many prefabricated story elements into the running time 
52644,this loud and thoroughly obnoxious comedy 
52645,though clearly wellintentioned  this crosscultural soap opera is painfully formulaic and stilted  
52646,a nice little story in the process 
52647,way too much indulgence of scenechewing  teethgnashing actorliness 
52648,is a vulgar 
52649,chilly  remote  emotionally distant piece

52655,inspire even the most retiring heart to venture forth 
52656,find a place among the studio s animated classics 
52657,that  half an hour in  starts making water torture seem appealing 
52658,our culture is headed down the toilet with the ferocity of a frozen burrito after an allnight tequila bender  and i know this because i ve seen  jackass  the movie  
52659,a big corner office in hell 
52660,on every frame of this stylish film that is able to visualize schizophrenia but is still confident enough to step back and look at the sick character with a sane eye 
52661,smart new comedy 
52662,get bogged down in earnest dramaturgy 
52663,s meandering  low on energy  and too eager to be quirky at moments 
52664,too slow for a younger crowd 
52665,as an introduction to the man s theories and influence  derrida is all but useless  as a portrait of the artist as an endlessly inquisitive old man  however  it s invaluable 
52666,a long  unfunny one at that 
52667,is filled with raw emotions conveying despair and love 
52668,who comes to america speaking not a word of english 
52669,obviously desired 
52670,interesting cinematic devices 
52671,an uneasy marriage

52680,may scream low budget 
52681,is that there is nothing in it to engage children emotionally  
52682,return to never land may be another shameless attempt by disney to rake in dough from baby boomer families  
52683,a high water mark for this genre 
52684,a memorable experience that  like many of his works  presents weighty issues colorfully wrapped up in his own idiosyncratic strain of kitschy goodwill  
52685,shyamalan takes a potentially trite and overused concept  aliens come to earth  and infuses it into a rustic  realistic  and altogether creepy tale of hidden invasion  
52686,far more witty 
52687,piercingly affecting  while clearly a manipulative film  emerges as powerful rather than cloying 
52688,the whole package certainly captures the intended  er  spirit of the piece 
52689,as darkly funny  
52690,family togetherness takes a back seat to interfamily rivalry and workplace ambition 
52691,that made it all work

52699,freeman ca nt save it 
52700,will absolutely crack you up with her crass  then gasp for gas  verbal deportment  
52701,its simplicity puts an exclamation point on the fact that this is nt something to be taken seriously  but it also wrecks any chance of the movie rising above similar fare  
52702,us is a minor miracle 
52703,three hours and with very little story or character 
52704,is a feast for the eyes 
52705,shot all the way

52838,it s possible that something hip and transgressive was being attempted here that stubbornly refused to gel  but the result is more puzzling than unsettling 
52839,the acting in pauline and paulette is good all round  but what really sets the film apart is debrauwer s refusal to push the easy emotional buttons

52889,conveys the passion  creativity  and fearlessness of one of mexico s most colorful and controversial artists  a captivating drama that will speak to the nonconformist in us all 
52890,while it may not add up to the sum of its parts  holofcener s film offers just enough insight to keep it from being simpleminded  and the ensemble cast is engaging enough to keep you from shifting in your chair too often

53002,sabotaged by ticking time bombs and other hollywoodaction cliches 
53003,turn a larky chase movie into an emotionally satisfying exploration of the very human need to be somebody  and to belong to somebody  
53004,with witty dialogue and inventive moments 
53005,amused and entertained by the unfolding of bielinsky s cleverly constructed scenario  and greatly impressed by the skill of the actors involved in the enterprise

53023,is it a charming  funny and beautifully crafted import  it uses very little dialogue  making it relatively effortless to read and follow the action at the same time  
53024,this rather unfocused  alloverthemap movie would be a lot better if it pared down its plots and characters to a few rather than dozens  or if it were subtler  or if it had a sense of humor  
53025,is a goofy pleasure 
53026,remains mostly undeterminable 
53027,bizarre

53121,sharp and quick documentary 
53122,robert harmon s lessismore approach delivers real bumpin  thenight chills 
53123,is silly but strangely believable  
53124,it falls short 
53125, not the craven of  a nightmare on elm street  or  the hills have eyes   but the sad schlock merchant of  deadly friend 
53126,found its audience  probably because it s extremely hard to relate to any of the characters  
53127,fastpaced and 
53128,too silly to take seriously  
53129,i almost expected there to be a collection taken for the comedian at the end of the show  
53130,not without cheesy fun factor  
53131,enough intelligence  wit or innovation on the screen to attract and sustain an older crowd 
53132,rewarding  
53133,secret ballot is a comedy  both gentle and biting 
53134,able to overcome his personal obstacles and become a good man 
53135,cheaplooking version of candid camera staged for the marquis de sade set 
53136,with an unusual protagonist  a kiltwearing jackson  and subject matter  the improbable  formula 51  is somewhat entertaining  but 
53137,the nation 
53138,some remarkable achival film 
53139,for this sort of thing to work  we need agile performers  but the proficient  dull sorvino has no light touch  and rodan is out of his league  
53140,enthusiastically taking up the current teen movie concern with bodily functions 
53141,the past via surrealist flourishes 
53142,pictures

53150,video  and so devoid of artifice and purpose 
53151,cagney s  top of the world  has been replaced by the bottom of the barrel 
53152,a compelling yarn  but not quite a ripping one  
53153,to both people s capacity for evil and their heroic capacity for good 
53154, it runs for 170 
53155,extraordinarily talented 
53156,try hard but come off too amateurish and awkward  
53157,with cardboard characters and performers 
53158,anyone with a passion for cinema  and indeed sex  should see it as soon as possible   
53159,rude 
53160,stopped thinking about how good it all was  and started doing nothing but reacting to it  feeling a part of its grand locations  thinking urgently as the protagonists struggled  feeling at the mercy of its inventiveness  gasping at its visual delights 
53161,annoying and artificial 
53162,firsttime writerdirector dylan kidd also has a good ear for dialogue  and the characters sound like real people  
53163,an immensely entertaining look at some of the unsung heroes of 20th century pop music  
53164, the film is extremely thorough  
53165,of ghandi gone bad 
53166,soderbergh s best films

53175,a pleasant distraction 
53176,in a poorly 
53177,confidently orchestrated  aesthetically and sexually 
53178,seem motivated by nothing short of dull  braindeadening hangover

53184,are so well tuned that the film comes off winningly  even though it s never as solid as you want it to be 
53185,guns  cheatfully filmed martial arts  disintegrating bloodsucker computer effects and jagged camera moves that serve no other purpose than to call attention to themselves 
53186,that kate is nt very bright  but 
53187,as saccharine movies go  this is likely to cause massive cardiac arrest if taken in large doses  
53188,to get inside you and stay there for a couple of hours 
53189,you are curious to see the darker side of what s going on with young tv actors  dawson leery did what    or see some interesting storytelling devices

53194, davis  wants to cause his audience an epiphany  yet he refuses to give us real situations and characters  
53195,delivers on that promise  
53196,a cruelly funny twist on teen comedy 
53197,be galled that you ve wasted nearly two hours of your own precious life with this silly little puddle of a movie 
53198,chill 
53199,yet fail to capture its visual appeal or its atmosphere 
53200,alternately fascinating and frustrating documentary 
53201,simply put   far from heaven  is a masterpiece  
53202,enhances the personal touch of manual animation  
53203,directed  barely  by there 
53204,is hollow  selfindulgent  and  worst of all  boring  
53205,all portent and no content 
53206,aimlessness 
53207,atmospheric weirdness 
53208,mel gibson can gasp  shudder and even tremble without losing his machismo 
53209,that plays better only for the film s publicists or for people who take as many drugs as the film s characters 
53210,done way too often 
53211,this odd  distant portuguese import more or less borrows from bad lieutenant and les vampires  and comes up with a kind of arthouse gay porn film  
53212,perfect show 
53213,looking at his 12th oscar nomination 
53214,seem barely in the same movie 
53215,spielberg knows how to tell us about people  
53216,the fact that it is nt very good is almost beside the point  
53217,a fragment of an underdone potato 
53218,have fun with it 
53219,great charm  generosity and diplomacy 
53220,falters in its recycled aspects  implausibility  and sags in pace 
53221,much funnier than anything 
53222,the movie s most admirable quality 
53223,the longest 90 minutes 
53224,disguising this 
53225,pale successor 
53226,a graceful  moving tribute to the courage of new york s finest and a nicely understated expression of the grief shared by the nation at their sacrifice  
53227,a film worth watching 
53228,by it  the kind of movie 
53229,excellent 
53230,was lazy but enjoyable 
53231,what the movie lacks in action 
53232,with the intricate preciseness of the best short story writing 
53233,another remarkable yet shockingly littleknown perspective 
53234, the characters are too simplistic to maintain interest  
53235,to feel anything much while watching this movie  beyond mild disturbance or detached pleasure at the acting 
53236,gamely as the movie tries to make sense of its title character  there remains a huge gap between the film s creepy 
53237,like the world of his film  hartley created a monster but did nt know how to handle it  
53238,dramaturgy 
53239,odd and 
53240,play out realistically if not always fairly 
53241,a masterpiece  and a challenging one 
53242,like a mediumgrade network sitcom  mostly inoffensive  fitfully amusing  but ultimately so weightless that a decent draft in the auditorium might blow it off the screen  
53243,flaws igby 
53244,surehanded 
53245,too long and 
53246,is so different from the apple and so striking that it can only encourage us to see samira makhmalbaf as a very distinctive sensibility  working to develop her own film language with conspicuous success  
53247,small delights 
53248,composed or edited 
53249,the best possible ways 
53250,hopes and dreams 
53251,made watchable by a bravura performance 
53252,exactly what its title implies  lusty  boisterous and utterly charming  
53253,is in his hypermasculine element here  once again able to inject some real vitality and even art into a pulpy concept that  in many other hands would be completely forgettable 
53254,to have you scratching your head than hiding under your seat  
53255,a backstage mustsee for true fans 
53256,enjoyable undercover brother 
53257,tremendous  offbeat sense 
53258,worse 
53259,struggles to rebel against his oppressive  rightwing  proprietyobsessed family  
53260,to question why somebody might devote time to see it 
53261,s a real shame 
53262,an ungainly movie  
53263,an allegory concerning the chronically mixed signals african american professionals get about overachieving could be intriguing 
53264,to perfect use in the breathtakingly beautiful outerspace documentary space station 3d 
53265,a remarkable amount 
53266,inventive  
53267,an ebullient affection for industrialmodel meat freezers 
53268,allows the characters to inhabit their world without cleaving to a narrative arc 
53269,unexpected blast 
53270,great piece to watch with kids and use to introduce video as art 
53271,a vivid imagination and 
53272,a majestic achievement  an epic of astonishing grandeur and surprising emotional depth 
53273,even better than the first one 
53274,you d grab your kids and run and then probably call the police  
53275,almost all of its accumulated enjoyment with a crucial third act miscalculation 
53276,visually engrossing  seldom hammy  
53277,love it  too 
53278,take a rocket scientist to figure out that this is a mormon family movie  and a sappy  preachy one at that 
53279,weird 
53280,does nt end up having much that is fresh to say about growing up catholic or  really  anything  
53281,a rather unique approach 
53282,it s tremendously moving 
53283,hoffman s quirks and mannerisms  particularly his penchant for tearing up on cue  things that seem so real in small doses  become annoying and artificial  
53284,is an encyclopedia of cliches that shoplifts shamelessly from farewelltoinnocence movies like the wanderers and a bronx tale without cribbing any of their intelligence  
53285,best films 
53286,completely awful iranian drama  as much fun as a grouchy ayatollah in a cold mosque  
53287,suspect it might deliver again and again 
53288,is a desperate miscalculation 
53289,have you talking til the end of the year 
53290,a sense of action 
53291,has taken quite a nosedive from alfred hitchcock s imaginative flight to shyamalan s selfimportant summer fluff  
53292,they fascinate in their recklessness  
53293,s a persistent theatrical sentiment and a woozy quality to the manner of the storytelling  which undercuts the devastatingly telling impact of utter loss personified in the film s simple title 
53294,it interesting as a character study is the fact that the story is told from paul s perspective 
53295,tries so hard to be quirky and funny that the strain is all too evident  
53296,often shocking but ultimately worthwhile exploration of motherhood and desperate mothers 
53297,her own screenplay  jumps to the head of the class of women s films that manage to avoid the ghetto of sentimental chickflicks by treating female follies with a satirical style 
53298,keep it from being a total rehash 
53299,uneven but a lot of fun 
53300,hitting your head on the theater seat 
53301,an example of the kind of lush  allenveloping movie experience 
53302,hypocritical work 
53303,lack a strongminded viewpoint  or a sense of humor 
53304,laden with plenty of baggage 
53305,with complicated plotting and banal dialogue 
53306,plot  characters  drama  emotions  ideas  all are irrelevant to the experience of seeing the scorpion king  
53307,uninspired 
53308,just how much more grueling and timeconsuming the illusion of work is than actual work 
53309,a pleasant piece 
53310,an excellent cast 
53311,it s unlikely to inspire anything more than a visit to mcdonald s  let alone some savvy street activism 
53312,episode 
53313,have an original bone in his body 
53314,is an unsettling sight  and indicative of his  if you will  outofkilter character  who rambles aimlessly through illconceived action pieces 
53315,feel absolutely earned 
53316,slippery slope 
53317,gets vivid  convincing performances from a fine cast  
53318,all of it works smoothly under the direction of spielberg  who does a convincing impersonation here of a director enjoying himself immensely  
53319,by turns touching  raucously amusing  uncomfortable  and  yes  even sexy  never again is a welcome and heartwarming addition to the romantic comedy genre  
53320,sickly 
53321,impossible as it may sound  this film s heart is even more embracing than monty  if only because it accepts nasty behavior and severe flaws as part of the human condition  
53322,probably want to see it twice 
53323,by his lack of selfawareness 
53324,the fluid motion is astounding on any number of levels  including the physical demands made on büttner  
53325, it s also cold  gray  antiseptic and emotionally desiccated  
53326,that expands into a meditation on the deep deceptions of innocence 
53327,s bright 
53328, the emotions seem authentic 
53329,close enough in spirit to its freewheeling trashcinema roots to be a breath of fresh air  
53330,  it also rocks  
53331,lifechanging chance encounters 
53332,female friendship  spiked with raw urban humor 
53333,is many things  stoner midnight flick  scifi deconstruction  gay fantasia  
53334,audaciousimpossible 
53335,the visual panache 
53336,in practice it s something else altogether  clownish and offensive and nothing at all like real life 
53337,a more measured or polished production ever could 
53338,appeal to those without much interest in the elizabethans 
53339,a stylish thriller  
53340,the movie is a trove of delights  
53341,constructs 
53342,nicks sustains the level of exaggerated  stylized humor throughout by taking your expectations and twisting them just a bit  
53343,this is a story that zings all the way through with originality  humor and pathos  
53344,chris 
53345,it may be the most oddly honest hollywood document of all 
53346,when commercialism has squeezed the life out of whatever idealism american moviemaking ever had 
53347,it might be  easier  to watch on video at home 
53348,a sly female empowerment movie  
53349,whether it s the worst movie of 2002  i ca nt say for sure  memories of rollerball have faded  and i skipped country bears 
53350,hits the bullseye 
53351,with formalist experimentation in cinematic art 
53352,s a very sincere work 
53353,searching for a quarter in a giant pile of elephant feces  
53354,a dualistic battle between good and evil 
53355,unembarrassing but unmemorable 
53356,are becoming irritating

53358,comes together as a coherent whole  
53359,improvement 
53360,languishing 
53361,even though many of these guys are less than adorable  their lamentations are pretty much selfcentered   there s something vital about the movie  
53362,leblanc thought   hey  the movie about the baseballplaying monkey was worse   
53363,forget that they are actually movie folk 
53364,s also uninspired  lacking the real talent and wit to elevate it beyond its formula to the level of classic romantic comedy to which it aspires 
53365,rush 
53366,is amiss in the world  
53367,overcome his personal obstacles and become a good man 
53368,twice as powerful

53379,britney s cutoffs 
53380,has said that warm water under a red bridge is a poem to the enduring strengths of women 
53381,struck me as unusually and unimpressively fussy and pretentious  
53382,the clichériddled genre 
53383,certified 
53384,straightforward and oldfashioned 
53385, innovative  and  realistic  
53386,really is a panamerican movie  with moments of genuine insight into the urban heart  
53387,creates a portrait of two strong men in conflict  inextricably entwined through family history  each seeing himself in the other  neither liking what he sees 
53388,features terrible  banal dialogue  convenient  holeridden plotting  superficial characters and a rather dull  unimaginative car chase  
53389,is attractive 
53390,is a wonderful thing  that he has been able to share his story so compellingly with us is a minor miracle 
53391,amusements 
53392,director rick famuyiwa s emergence as an articulate  grownup voice in africanamerican cinema 
53393,seem goofy rather than provocative 
53394,the strain of its plot contrivances and its need to reassure 
53395,something i would rather live in denial about 
53396,it ca nt really be called animation 
53397,motivated by something more than franchise possibilities 
53398,with the lovely hush 
53399,roussillon providing comic relief 
53400,the film does a solid job of slowly  steadily building up to the climactic burst of violence  
53401,of the clients 
53402,the eye candy here lacks considerable brio  
53403,own fear and paranoia 
53404,elling and kjell bjarne become symbolic characters whose actions are supposed to relate something about the naïf s encounter with the world

53410,romantic thriller 
53411,dancing 
53412,wonderfully creepy mood 
53413,the film fearlessly gets under the skin of the people involved  this makes it not only a detailed historical document  but an engaging and moving portrait of a subculture 
53414,a heartland so overwhelmed by its lack of purpose that it seeks excitement in manufactured high drama 
53415, if predictable  
53416,crack a smile at 
53417,emphatic 
53418,what s best about 
53419, cultivation and devotion 
53420,there s backstabbing  interracial desire and  most importantly  singing and dancing  
53421,in the new release of cinema paradiso  the tale has turned from sweet to bittersweet  and when the tears come during that final  beautiful scene  they finally feel absolutely earned  
53422,surprisingly powerful and universal  
53423, it does a disservice to the audience and to the genre  
53424,who are alternately touching and funny 
53425,trying to make head or tail of the story in the hiphop indie snipes is enough to give you brain strain  and 
53426,spirals downward 
53427,you ll swear that you ve seen it all before  even if you ve never come within a mile of the longest yard  
53428,loves both dance and cinema 
53429,i enjoyed barbershop 
53430,they do nt fit well together and neither is well told

53434,pointed personalities  courage  tragedy and the little guys 
53435,the young woman s infirmity and her naive dreams 
53436,one of those exceedingly rare films in which the talk alone is enough to keep us involved  
53437,for an unfocused screenplay 
53438,chaotic 
53439,me no lika da accents so good  
53440,an uneven mix of dark satire and childhood awakening  
53441,spirit is a visual treat  and it takes chances that are bold by studio standards  but it lacks a strong narrative  
53442,smeary and blurry 
53443,serious 
53444,some of the computer animation is handsome  and various amusing sidekicks add muchneeded levity to the otherwise bleak tale  but overall the film never rises above mediocrity  
53445,care too much about this love story 
53446,pause and think of what we have given up to acquire the fastpaced contemporary society 
53447,a visionary marvel 
53448,such a mechanical endeavor

53469,it takes you somewhere 
53470,is it a comedy  
53471,cry for your money back 
53472,airs just about every cliche in the war movie compendium across its indulgent twohourandfifteenminute length 
53473,the lightest  most breezy movie steven spielberg 
53474,is like a beautiful food entrée that is nt heated properly  so that it ends up a bit cold and relatively flavorless  
53475,kline s superbly nuanced performance 
53476,mr chabrol s subtlest works 
53477,is nothing but a convenient conveyor belt of brooding personalities that parade about as if they were coming back from stock character camp  a drowsy drama infatuated by its own pretentious selfexamination 
53478,unleashes his trademark misogyny  er  comedy  
53479,not many movies have that kind of impact on me these days  
53480,with too little 
53481,a little less blingbling and a lot more romance 
53482,an unholy mess 
53483,improvised on a daytoday basis during production 
53484,laughable dialogue 
53485,a colorful  vibrant introduction 
53486,the most creative  energetic and original

53488, wilde s play is a masterpiece of elegant wit and artifice  
53489,befuddled 
53490,strangely hollow at its emotional core 
53491, gritty  sometimes funny 
53492,stupidity 
53493,to knock back a beer with but they re simply not funny performers 
53494,a film of epic scale with an intimate feeling  a saga of the ups and downs of friendships

54136,belongs in the toohotfortv directtovideodvd category  and this is why i have given it a onestar rating

54824,irksome  tiresome nature 
54825,miraculous as its dreamworks makers 
54826,wrong with a comedy where the only belly laughs come from the selection of outtakes tacked onto the end credits 
54827,brian tufano s handsome widescreen photography and paul grabowsky s excellent music turn this fairly parochial melodrama into something really rather special  
54828, best part  of the movie 
54829,judith and zaza s extended bedroom sequence  is so intimate and sensual and funny and psychologically selfrevealing that it makes most of what passes for sex in the movies look like cheap hysterics  
54830,pretends to be passionate and truthful 
54831,is too optimistic a title  
54832,create characters who are sweet and believable  and are defeated by a screenplay that forces them into bizarre  implausible behavior 
54833,by its end offers a ray of hope to the refugees able to look ahead and resist living in a past 
54834,will see nothing in it to match the ordeal of sitting through it 
54835,a welcome relief from baseball movies that try too hard to be mythic  this one is a sweet and modest and ultimately winning story  
54836,hard to resist his pleas to spare wildlife and respect their environs

54840,yeah  baby 
54841, amusing  sad and reflective 
54842,enjoyable  
54843,comedy that also asks its audience  in a heartwarming  nonjudgmental kind of way  to consider what we value in our daily lives 
54844,laughably 
54845,at least terribly monotonous 
54846,able to look ahead and resist living in a past

54848,lackluster script 
54849,might to resist 
54850,could have written a more credible script  though with the same number of continuity errors 
54851,which is nothing to sneeze at these days 
54852,which means he can be forgiven for frequently pandering to fans of the grossout comedy 
54853,alienating most 
54854,perfectly acceptable  occasionally very enjoyable children s entertainment 
54855,cloaked in the euphemism  urban drama 
54856,neither is well told

54861,through the audience s meat grinder one more 
54862,one of the funnier movies in town  
54863,brave and sweetly rendered love story  
54864,compromise with reality enough to become comparatively sane and healthy 
54865,olympia  wash  based filmmakers anne de marcken and marilyn freeman did just that and it s what makes their project so interesting 
54866,a twisting  unpredictable  catandmouse thriller 
54867,s a lovely  eerie film that casts an odd  rapt spell  
54868,of the war 
54869,ambitious  unsettling psychodrama that takes full  chilling advantage of its rougharoundtheedges  lowbudget constraints 
54870,in the conception than it does in the execution 
54871,has nothing 
54872,is amused by its special effects 
54873,literary purists may not be pleased  but as far as mainstream matineestyle entertainment goes  it does a bangup job of pleasing the crowds  
54874,such a bad movie 
54875,i shamelessly enjoyed it 
54876,or maybe  how will you feel after an 88minute ripoff of the rock with action confined to slomo gun firing and random glassshattering   
54877,corny examination 
54878,the wit 
54879,even life on an aircraft carrier

54884,dumb  narratively chaotic  visually sloppy  
54885,to the dullest irish pub scenes 
54886,goes to absurd lengths to duck the very issues it raises 
54887,what makes this film special is serry s ability to take what is essentially a contained family conflict and put it into a much larger historical context  
54888,truly funny bits 
54889,pseudophilosophic twaddle 
54890,hardtoswallow premise 
54891,hallmark commercial 
54892,despair 
54893,ends up offering nothing more than the latest schwarzenegger or stallone flick 
54894,this wo nt seem like such a bore 
54895,we ve seen it all before in one form or another  but director hoffman  with great help from kevin kline  makes us care about this latest reincarnation of the world s greatest teacher  
54896,straightforward  emotionally honest manner 
54897,truly enjoyed most of mostly martha while i ne 
54898,develops a startling story that works both as a detailed personal portrait and as a rather frightening examination of modern times  
54899,at its best  which occurs often 
54900,threadbare standbys 
54901,literate material 
54902,eventually works its way up to merely bad rather than painfully awful  
54903,director ever making his wife look so bad in a major movie 
54904,despite its floating narrative 
54905,s no good answer to that one  
54906,has a more colorful  more playful tone than his other films  
54907,in eyepopping visuals 
54908,alltime great apocalypse movies 
54909,more than adequately fills the eyes and 
54910,salma hayek has a feel for the character at all stages of her life 
54911,its salient points are simultaneously buried  drowned and smothered in the excesses of writerdirector roger avary  
54912,than i d expected it to be 
54913,well worth revisiting 
54914,a gracious  eloquent film that by its end offers a ray of hope to the refugees able to look ahead and resist living in a past 
54915,remarkable procession 
54916,loses all bite on the big screen  
54917,our emotions 
54918,it s pretty linear and only makeupdeep  but bogdanovich ties it together with efficiency and an affection for the period  
54919,take his smooth  shrewd  powerful act abroad 
54920,the world s political situation seems little different  and  director phillip  noyce brings out the allegory with remarkable skill 
54921,an insultingly inept and artificial examination of grief and its impacts upon the relationships of the survivors 
54922,a compelling film  
54923,makes you realize that deep inside righteousness can be found a tough beauty 
54924,s some good material in their story about a retail clerk wanting more out of life 
54925,a stab at soccer hooliganism  a doublebarreled ripoff of quentin tarantino s climactic shootout  
54926,it would nt matter so much that this arrogant richard pryor wannabe s routine is offensive  puerile and unimaginatively foulmouthed if it was at least funny  
54927,as one of the great submarine stories 
54928,lagaan 
54929,provide its thrills and extreme emotions 
54930,marred beyond redemption by a disastrous ending 
54931,seems hopelessly juvenile 
54932,appreciates the art and reveals a music scene that transcends culture and race 
54933,laggard drama wending its way to an uninspired philosophical epiphany 
54934,attempt to pass this stinker off as a scary movie 
54935,a movie full of surprises 
54936,bolstered by exceptional performances and 
54937, butterfingered  is the word for the bigfisted direction of jez butterworth  who manages to blast even the smallest sensitivities from the romance with his clamorous approach  
54938,a heavy stench of  been there  done that  hanging over the film 
54939,turns out to be clever  amusing and unpredictable 
54940,entertaining tricks 
54941,more than competent 
54942,frequently veers into corny sentimentality  probably 
54943,the miniseries 
54944,at once visceral and spiritual  wonderfully vulgar and sublimely lofty  and 
54945,turn and devolves 
54946,have brought back the value and respect for the term epic cinema 
54947,the power of the huston performance 
54948,super troopers suffers because it does nt have enough vices to merit its 103minute length

54952,dirty 
54953,good action  good acting  good dialogue  good pace  
54954,dull as its characters  about whose fate it is hard to care 
54955,transforms that reality into a lyrical and celebratory vision 
54956,its story is only surface deep 
54957,is listless  witless  and devoid of anything 
54958,an incredibly thoughtful  deeply meditative picture that neatly and effectively captures the debilitating grief felt in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks  
54959,movie that portrays the frank humanity of  emotional recovery 
54960,one funny popcorn flick  
54961,although  visually striking and slickly staged 
54962, masterful 
54963,wonderfully warm human drama 
54964,bigger and more ambitious than the first installment 
54965,now  told by hollywood  and much more ordinary for it 
54966,worst movie 
54967,it made me feel unclean  and i m the guy who liked there s something about mary and both american pie movies 
54968,great minds 
54969,a winning comedy with its wry observations about longlived friendships and the ways in which we all lose track of ourselves by trying to please others  
54970,ultimately offers nothing more than people in an urban jungle needing other people to survive 
54971,scotland looks wonderful  
54972,disposable  kitchensink homage 
54973,spirit is a visual treat  and it takes chances that are bold by studio standards  but 
54974,expiration date 
54975,powerful look 
54976,such highwattage brainpower coupled with pitchperfect acting and an exquisite  unfakable sense of cinema 
54977,a couple of saps stuck in an inarticulate screenplay 
54978,catching for griffiths  warm and winning central performance 
54979,bind us 
54980,one strike 
54981,it was nt horrible either 
54982,a fine production with splendid singing by angela gheorghiu  ruggero raimondi  and roberto alagna 
54983,you have figured out the con and the players in this debut film by argentine director fabian bielinsky 
54984,the delicate forcefulness of greene s prose 
54985,it s better suited for the history or biography channel  but there s no arguing the tone of the movie  it leaves a bad taste in your mouth and questions on your mind  
54986, it s better than one might expect when you look at the list of movies starring icet in a major role  
54987,in the most blithe exchanges gives the film its lingering tug 
54988,something of a stiff 
54989, retro uplifter  
54990,what s missing in murder by numbers is any real psychological grounding for the teens  deviant behavior  
54991,ryan gosling is  in a word  brilliant as the conflicted daniel  
54992,the otherwise goodnaturedness of mr deeds  with its embrace of sheer goofiness and cameos of less  thanlikely new york celebrities 
54993,uses a totally unnecessary prologue  
54994,also looked like crap  so crap is what i was expecting  
54995,s very little 
54996,alcatraz   a cinematic corpse 
54997,a one liner as well as anybody 
54998,the cleverness  the weirdness and the pristine camerawork 
54999,totally 
55000,is far more appealing 
55001,of very bad scouse accents 
55002,the sheer beauty of his images 
55003,of laughs in this simple  sweet and romantic comedy 
55004,this tired retread 
55005,not quite 
55006,have pulled off four similar kidnappings before 
55007,its inescapable absurdities are tantamount to insulting the intelligence of anyone who has nt been living under a rock  since sept 11   
55008,is good at being the ultraviolent gangster wannabe 
55009,fortunately  elling never gets too cloying thanks to the actors  perfect comic timing and sweet  genuine chemistry  
55010,lastminute 
55011,part of the film s cheeky charm comes from its vintage schmaltz  
55012,so aggressively antierotic 
55013,have a hard time sitting through this one 
55014,reminiscent 
55015,suffers from overfamiliarity since hithungry british filmmakers have stripmined the monty formula mercilessly since 1997  
55016,deception 
55017,feature to hit theaters since beauty and the beast 11 years ago 
55018,has severe body odor

55022,spirit is a visual treat  and it takes chances that are bold by studio standards  
55023,huge sacrifice 
55024,goes beyond his usual fluttering and stammering and captures the soul of a man in pain who gradually comes to recognize it and deal with it 
55025,make showtime the most savory and hilarious guilty pleasure of many a recent movie season 
55026,dover kosashvili s outstanding feature debut 
55027,delightful  if minor  
55028,no level whatsoever for me 
55029,to create a very compelling  sensitive  intelligent and almost cohesive piece of film entertainment 
55030,is this bad on purpose 
55031, that s because panic room is interested in nothing more than sucking you in  and making you sweat  
55032,is an interesting movie   
55033,offers a thoughtful and rewarding glimpse 
55034,pertinent and enduring 
55035,s stylishly directed with verve  
55036,its shortness disappoints 
55037,deeply meditative picture 
55038,until it veered off too far into the exxon zone  and left me behind at the station looking for a return ticket to realism 
55039,this prickly indie comedy of manners and misanthropy 
55040,compassionate spirit 
55041,great dragons  
55042,i have returned from the beyond to warn you  this movie is 90 minutes long  and life is too short 
55043,a memorable experience 
55044,serves up with style and empathy 
55045,keep our interest 
55046,gooding is the energetic frontman  and it s hard to resist his enthusiasm  even if the filmmakers come up with nothing original in the way of slapstick sequences 
55047,absurd plot twists  idiotic court maneuvers and stupid characters 
55048, the characters   misery 
55049,hardly an objective documentary  but it s great cinematic polemic  love moore or loathe him  you ve got to admire  the intensity with which he s willing to express his convictions 
55050,effectiveness 
55051,the one notsosmall problem with expecting is that the entire exercise has no real point  
55052,an intriguing twist 
55053,succeeds due to its rapidfire delivery and enough inspired levity that it ca nt be dismissed as mindless 
55054,rejects 
55055,infidelity and 
55056,a genuinely funny ensemble 
55057,got to hand it to director george clooney for biting off such a big job the first time out 
55058,fabulously funny 
55059,might survive a screening with little harm done  except maybe for the last 15 minutes  which are as maudlin as any afterschool special you can imagine 
55060,seems worth the effort  
55061,terrific date movie 
55062,not a trace of humanity or empathy 
55063,fourth feature 
55064,reign of fire is so incredibly inane that it is laughingly enjoyable  
55065,a milquetoast movie of the week blown up for the big screen 
55066,predictable plot 
55067,the visual flair and bouncing bravado that characterizes better hiphop clips and is content to recycle images and characters that were already tired 10 years ago 
55068,does strong  measured work 
55069,more and more frustrated and detached as vincent became more and more abhorrent 
55070,it is nt that funny 
55071,slovenly life in this selfdeprecating  biting and witty feature written by charlie kaufman and his twin brother  donald  and directed by spike jonze 
55072,sporadic bursts of liveliness  some soso slapstick and a few earpleasing songs on its soundtrack 
55073,squeeze the action and our emotions into the alltoofamiliar dramatic arc of the holocaust escape story 
55074,an engaging criminal romp that will have viewers guessing just who s being conned right up to the finale  
55075,crowdpleasing goals 
55076,tolerate this insipid  brutally clueless film 
55077,does its best 
55078,solid  
55079,a baffling subplot 
55080,like a room stacked with pungent flowers 
55081,amuses 
55082,tasteful 
55083,on its empty head 
55084,to pass without reminding audiences that it s only a movie 
55085,recite bland police procedural details  fiennes wanders 
55086,s super  violent  superserious and superstupid 
55087,numbingly dull experience 
55088,the chance it affords to watch jackson  who also served as executive producer  take his smooth  shrewd  powerful act abroad 
55089,never comes together as a coherent whole  
55090,i think it was plato who said   i think  therefore i know better than to rush to the theater for this one 
55091,cute drama 
55092, taut  piercing and feisty 
55093,cut to a new scene  which also appears to be the end  
55094,the movie barely makes sense  with its unbelievable naïveté and arbitrary flashbacks  
55095,unturned 
55096,far more successful 
55097,a remarkably insightful look at the backstage angst of the standup comic  
55098,has filmed the opera exactly as the libretto directs  ideally capturing the opera s drama and lyricism 
55099,being able to creep the living hell out of you 
55100,ourside the theater roger might be intolerable company  
55101,it revigorates the mind to see a feature that concentrates on people  a project in which the script and characters hold sway  
55102,deeply biased  and wholly 
55103,failing  ultimately  
55104,this is a movie so insecure about its capacity to excite that it churns up not one but two flagrantly fake thunderstorms to underscore the action  
55105,without having much dramatic impact 
55106,into a terribly obvious melodrama and roughhewn vanity project for lead actress andie macdowell 
55107,the histrionic muse still eludes madonna and  playing a charmless witch 
55108,of sweetandsour insider movie that film buffs will eat up like so much gelati 
55109,uplifting and moving 
55110,already tired 
55111,manages  with terrific flair  to keep the extremes of screwball farce and bloodcurdling family intensity on one continuum  
55112,marks him as one of the most interesting writerdirectors working today  
55113,worthless  from its pseudorockvideo opening to the idiocy of its last frames 
55114,the scruffy sands of its titular community 
55115,as searching for a quarter in a giant pile of elephant feces  positively dreadful 
55116,to make creative contributions to the story and dialogue 
55117,a delightful surprise because despite all the backstage drama  this is a movie that tells stories that work  is charming  is moving

56149,the soulsearching deliberateness of the film  although leavened nicely with dry absurdist wit  eventually becomes too heavy for the plot  
56150,rubbish 
56151,even though the film does nt manage to hit all of its marks  it s still entertaining to watch the target practice  
56152,a breathtaking adventure

58075,nicole holofcener s lovely and amazing  from her own screenplay  jumps to the head of the class of women s films that manage to avoid the ghetto of sentimental chickflicks by treating female follies with a satirical style  
58076,might have fun in this cinematic sandbox 
58077,obscure the message 
58078,charly comes off as emotionally manipulative and sadly imitative of innumerable past love story derisions  
58079,discloses almost nothing  
58080,by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss 
58081,feels aimless for much of its running time  until late in the film when a tidal wave of plot arrives  leaving questions in its wake  
58082,has a way of gently swaying back and forth as it cradles its characters  veiling tension beneath otherwise tender movements 
58083,a florid biopic about mad queens  obsessive relationships  and rampant adultery 
58084,shrewd  powerful act 
58085,what s attracting audiences to unfaithful

58090,of the finest 
58091,often shocking but ultimately worthwhile exploration 
58092,drama  
58093,the film feels homogenized and a bit contrived  as if we re looking back at a tattered and ugly past with rosetinted glasses  
58094,these brats will ever be anything more than losers 
58095,the color sense of stuart little 2 is its most immediate and most obvious pleasure  but it would count for very little if the movie were nt as beautifully shaped and as delicately calibrated in tone as it is  
58096,s waltzed itself into the art film pantheon  
58097,above easy  cynical potshots at morally bankrupt characters 
58098,to do with the casting of juliette binoche as sand  who brings to the role her pale  dark beauty and characteristic warmth

58169,a markedly inactive film  
58170, interview with the assassin draws its considerable power from simplicity  
58171,while the performances are often engaging  this loose collection of largely improvised numbers would probably have worked better as a onehour tv documentary

58302,its onesidedness  flirts with propaganda  
58303,murder hits and generally sustains a higher plateau with bullock s memorable first interrogation of gosling  
58304,it s a loathsome movie  it really is and it makes absolutely no sense  
58305,about which you can actually feel good 
58306,a wildly entertaining scan of evans  career  
58307,turns out to be smarter and more diabolical than you could have guessed at the beginning  
58308,is the last thing any of these three actresses  nor their characters  deserve  
58309,ache by the end of kung pow 
58310,a welcome improvement 
58311,narcissism 
58312,none of this is very original  and it is nt particularly funny  
58313,its unsettling prognosis 
58314,is just as good  if not better than much of what s on saturday morning tv especially the pseudoeducational stuff we all ca nt stand 
58315,the script by david koepp is perfectly serviceable and because he gives the story some soul 
58316,it has its faults  
58317,where normally good actors  even kingsley  are made to look bad 
58318,an engaging mystery 
58319,sharp comedy  oldfashioned monster movie atmospherics 
58320,they come  already having been recycled more times than i d care to count 
58321,handsome widescreen photography 
58322,is extremely funny  the first part making up for any flaws that come later  
58323,visual charm or texture 
58324,more of a creaky  pretty woman  retread  with the emphasis on selfempowering schmaltz and bigwave surfing that gives pic its title an afterthought 
58325,a cultureclash comedy 
58326,leave us with a sense of wonder at the diverse  marvelously twisted shapes history has taken 
58327,relegated to the background  a welcome step forward from the sally jesse raphael atmosphere of films like philadelphia and american beauty 
58328,s defiantly and delightfully against the grain 
58329,the trappings of i spy are so familiar you might as well be watching a rerun  
58330,where story is almost an afterthought 
58331,a conventional but heartwarming tale  
58332,formulaic  its plot and pacing typical hollywood warmovie stuff  while the performances elicit more of a sense of deja vu than awe 
58333,communicates something 
58334,the code talkers deserved better than a hollow tribute  
58335,the attempt to complicate the story only defies credibility 
58336,i liked the original short story but this movie  even at an hour and twentysome minutes  it s too long and it goes nowhere  
58337,more of an ordeal than an amusement 
58338,delivers what it promises  a look at the  wild ride  that ensues when brash young men set out to conquer the online world with laptops  cell phones and sketchy business plans  
58339,foul up shum s good intentions 
58340,bombs 
58341,dramatic comedy 
58342, what a banal bore the preachy circuit turns out to be 
58343,it is a great film  
58344,from terry gilliam s subconscious  pressed through kafka s meat grinder and into buñuel s casings 
58345,is not worth 
58346,sincere  and just 
58347,diaz wears out her welcome in her most charmless performance 
58348,if the film has a problem  its shortness disappoints  
58349,right at home 
58350,tackles the topic of relationships in such a straightforward  emotionally honest manner that by the end 
58351,the demented mind 
58352,sometimes the dreams of youth should remain just that 
58353,plays like a 95minute commercial for nba properties 
58354,flavorful performances 
58355,a formula comedy redeemed by its stars  
58356,to vary the pitch of his movie  balancing deafening battle scenes with quieter domestic scenes of women back home receiving war department telegrams 
58357,an entertainment 
58358,wickedly funny  
58359,has many of the things that made the first one charming  
58360,a case of too many chefs fussing over too weak a recipe 
58361,smashing success 
58362,go anywhere new  
58363,adventure 
58364,most opaque  
58365,both a successful adaptation and an enjoyable film in its own right 
58366,the somber pacing and lack of dramatic fireworks 
58367,sugar  admirably 
58368,notice the flaws 
58369,bland despite the heavy doses of weird performances and direction 
58370,is that they re stuck with a script that prevents them from firing on all cylinders 
58371,might not have gotten him into film school in the first place 
58372,that should please history fans 
58373,for what we can get on television for free 
58374,strange it is  but delightfully so 
58375,a great monster movie 
58376,a gracious  eloquent film that by its end offers a ray of hope to the refugees able to look ahead and resist living in a past forever lost  
58377,s probably not accurate to call it a movie 
58378,great sympathy and intelligence 
58379,its audience  in a heartwarming  nonjudgmental kind of way  
58380,ingratiating 
58381,in creating the layered richness of the imagery in this chiaroscuro of madness and light 
58382,s a lot of tooth in roger dodger 
58383,is shallow  offensive and redundant  
58384,it s hard to imagine anybody ever being  in the mood  to view a movie as harrowing and painful as the grey zone  but it s equally hard to imagine anybody being able to tear their eyes away from the screen once it s started  
58385,family fundamentals gets you riled up 
58386,and sometimes dry 
58387,though few will argue that it ranks with the best of herzog s works  invincible shows he s back in form  with an astoundingly rich film  
58388,gap 
58389,deserving of discussion 
58390,no character  
58391,the worst kind of mythologizing  
58392,as it stands  crocodile hunter has the hurried  badly cobbled look of the 1959 godzilla  which combined scenes of a japanese monster flick with canned shots of raymond burr commenting on the monster s path of destruction  
58393,the worst of the entire franchise 
58394,an incredibly heavyhanded  manipulative dud that feels all too familiar  
58395,the roundelay of partners functions  and the interplay within partnerships and among partnerships and the general air of gatorbashing are consistently delightful  
58396,see some interesting storytelling devices 
58397,although i did nt hate this one 
58398,there s enough cool fun here to warm the hearts of animation enthusiasts of all ages  
58399,a spontaneity to the chateau  a sense of lightheartedness  that makes it attractive throughout 
58400,need of some trims 
58401,selfconsciously 
58402,any of these three actresses  nor their characters  deserve 
58403,an average bmovie with no aspirations to be anything more 
58404,manages to accomplish what few sequels can 
58405,most touching movie of recent years 
58406,that stretches the running time about 10 minutes 
58407,such a good job 
58408,do nt think so 
58409,results is the best performance from either in years 
58410,its writerdirector s heart is in the right place  his plea for democracy and civic action laudable  
58411,a seriously intended movie 
58412,wo nt be remembered as one of  witherspoon s  better films 
58413,a bright  inventive 
58414,hard to imagine another director ever making his wife look so bad in a major movie 
58415,makes it all the more compelling 
58416,blues 
58417,gaping plot holes sink this  sub   
58418,its provocative central wedding sequence has far more impact 
58419,its seriousness and quality 
58420,is the sort of lowgrade dreck that usually goes straight to video  with a lousy script  inept direction  pathetic acting  poorly dubbed dialogue and murky cinematography  complete with visible boom mikes 
58421,robinson s web of suspense 
58422,the waterlogged script plumbs uncharted depths of stupidity  incoherence and subsophomoric sexual banter

58429,the film becomes an overwhelming pleasure  
58430,so crisp and economical in one false move 
58431,into  an inspiring tale of survival wrapped in the heartpounding suspense of a stylish psychological thriller 
58432,aging  suffering and the prospect of death 
58433,in between the icy stunts  the actors spout hilarious dialogue about following your dream and  just letting the mountain tell you what to do   
58434,paintbynumbers

58456,that would have been funnier if the director had released the outtakes theatrically and used the film as a bonus feature on the dvd 
58457,trimmed dickens  wonderfully sprawling soap opera  the better to focus on the hero s odyssey from cowering poverty to courage and happiness

58466,staring at a blank screen

58469,no amount of imagination  no creature  no fantasy story and no incredibly outlandish scenery 
58470,gaping plot holes sink this  sub   standard thriller and drag audience enthusiasm to crush depth 
58471,ghost ship is pretty landbound  with its leaden acting  dull exposition and telegraphed  surprises

58474,had all its vital essence scooped

58476,humdrum

58509,that has bucked the odds to emerge as an exquisite motion picture in its own right 
58510,lacks any real raw emotion  which is fatal for a film that relies on personal relationships 
58511, that the material is so secondrate

58529,full frontal had no effect and elicited no sympathies for any of the characters  
58530,should have been the ultimate imax trip 
58531,nothing in the movie makes a convincing case that one woman s broken heart outweighs all the loss we witness

59011,despite its hawaiian setting  the sciencefiction trimmings and some moments of rowdy slapstick  the basic plot of  lilo  could have been pulled from a tearstained vintage shirley temple script  
59012,is supposed to be madcap farce  
59013,with but they re simply not funny performers 
59014,change watching such a character  especially when rendered in as flat 
59015,too much like an infomercial for ram dass s latest book aimed at the boomer 
59016,sequences boring 
59017,no point in extracting the bare bones of byatt s plot for purposes of bland hollywood romance 
59018,these characters are so well established that the gang feels comfortable with taking insane liberties and doing the goofiest stuff out of left field  and 
59019,we hold dear about cinema  only now it s begun to split up so that it can do even more damage 
59020,bring fresh good looks and an ease in front of the camera to the work 
59021,appears jagged  as if filmed directly from a television monitor  while the extensive use of stock footage quickly becomes a tiresome cliché  
59022,compelling  provocative and prescient 
59023,  safe conduct   is a long movie at 163 minutes but it fills the time with drama  romance  tragedy  bravery  political intrigue  partisans and sabotage 
59024,meanspirited and 
59025, a  real pleasure in its laidback way 
59026,start reading your scripts before signing that dotted line

59028,pushiness and decibel 
59029,rich and sudden 
59030,most consumers of lo mein and general tso s chicken barely give a thought to the folks who prepare and deliver it  so  hopefully  this film will attach a human face to all those little steaming cartons

59049,pulpy 
59050,it s rare that a movie can be as intelligent as this one is in every regard except its storyline  everything that s good is ultimately scuttled by a plot that s just too boring and obvious 
59051,orchestrating a finale that is impenetrable and dull 
59052,stand as intellectual masterpieces next to the scorpion king 
59053,australian actordirector john polson and awardwinning english cinematographer giles nuttgens make a terrific effort at disguising the obvious with energy and innovation  
59054,wonderfully creepy 
59055,of a particularly nightmarish fairytale

59064,in fact  even better  
59065,this argentinean  dramedy  succeeds mainly on the shoulders of its actors  
59066,an incredibly heavyhanded  manipulative dud that feels all too familiar 
59067,to let you bask in your own cleverness as you figure it out 
59068,when poor hermocrates and leontine pathetically compare notes about their budding amours 
59069,please audiences who like movies that demand four hankies

59076,new york s finest and 
59077,any of the character dramas  which never reach satisfying conclusions 
59078,it s not as awful as some of the recent hollywood trip tripe  but it s far from a groundbreaking endeavor 
59079,might as well be watching a rerun 
59080,s kind of sad that so many people put so much time and energy into this turkey  
59081,the punch lines that miss 
59082,a determined  ennuihobbled slog that really does nt have much to say beyond the news flash that loneliness can make people act weird  
59083,for the film s publicists or for people who take as many drugs as the film s characters 
59084, i ll admit it  my only complaint is that we did nt get more recreations of all those famous moments from the show

59598,on its fairly ludicrous plot 
59599,be most effective if used as a tool to rally anticatholic protestors 
59600,and narrative grace 
59601,is entertainment opportunism at its most glaring  
59602,m not sure which half of dragonfly is worse  the part where nothing s happening  or the part where something s happening 
59603,more fun watching a documentary 
59604,sly  sophisticated and surprising 
59605,ratliff s two previous titles  plutonium circus and purgatory county show his penchant for wry  contentious configurations  and this film is part of that delicate canon  
59606,cassavetes thinks he s making dog day afternoon with a cause  but all he s done is to reduce everything he touches to a shrill  didactic cartoon  
59607,feels more like a rejected xfiles episode than a credible account of a puzzling reallife happening  
59608,wanderers and a bronx tale 
59609,stench 
59610,is gone  replaced by the forced funniness found in the dullest kiddie flicks 
59611,that s just too boring and obvious 
59612,cheerfully 
59613,i ve yet to find an actual vietnam war combat movie actually produced by either the north or south vietnamese  but at least now we ve got something pretty damn close 
59614,a mimetic approximation of better films like contempt and 8 12  
59615,is almost in a class with that of wilde himself 
59616,the film would have been more enjoyable had the balance shifted in favor of waterbound action over the landbased  drama   but the emphasis on the latter leaves blue crush waterlogged 
59617,overwrought you d swear he just stepped out of a buñuel retrospective 
59618,the richness 
59619,a silly hackandslash flick 
59620,has the screen presence to become a majorleague leading lady   but  
59621,some of the most poorly staged and lit action in memory 
59622,never having seen the first two films in the series  i ca nt compare friday after next to them  but nothing would change the fact that what we have here is a load of clams left in the broiling sun for a good three days 
59623,should jolt you out of your seat a couple of times  give you a few laughs  and leave you feeling like it was worth your seven bucks  even though it does turn out to be a bit of a cheat in the end 
59624,the audience when i saw this one was chuckling at all the wrong times  and 
59625,this time  the hype is quieter  and 
59626,the script assumes that not only would subtlety be lost on the target audience  but that it s also too stupid to realize that they ve already seen this exact same movie a hundred times 
59627,decent draft 
59628,the film has an infectious enthusiasm and we re touched by the film s conviction that all life centered on that place  that time and that sport  
59629,brilliantly played 
59630,got it right the first time 
59631,seagal  who looks more like danny aiello these days  mumbles his way through the movie

59633,shrieky special effects 
59634,high crimes carries almost no organic intrigue as a government  marinelegal mystery  and that s because the movie serves up all of that stuff  nearly subliminally  as the oldhat province of male intrigue 
59635,the modern rut 
59636,are bad 
59637,that wastes the talents of its attractive young leads

59653,be mesmerised 
59654,dumb  narratively chaotic  
59655,a delightful stimulus for the optic nerves  so much that it s forgivable that the plot feels like every other tale of a totalitarian tomorrow  
59656,at once overly oldfashioned in its sudsy plotting and heavyhanded in its effort to modernize it with encomia to diversity and tolerance  
59657,through a dreary tract of virtually plotless meanderings 
59658,sure  it s contrived and predictable  but its performances are so well tuned that the film comes off winningly  even though it s never as solid as you want it to be 
59659,yet it s not quite the genrebusting film it s been hyped to be because it plays everything too safe  
59660,high camp and yet another sexual taboo into a really funny movie 
59661,unfolds as sand s masculine persona  with its love of life and beauty  takes form

59666,wholly unnecessary precredit sequence 
59667,on sophisticated  discerning taste 
59668,right tone 
59669, unspeakably  unbearably dull  featuring reams of flatly delivered dialogue and a heroine who comes across as both shallow and dimwitted  
59670,most excruciating 
59671,to newcastle  the first half of gangster no 1 drips with style and  at times  blood 
59672,the increasingly diverse french director 
59673,boredom to the point of collapse 
59674,this stuck pig 
59675,combines sharp comedy  oldfashioned monster movie atmospherics  and genuine heart to create a film that s not merely about kicking undead   but also about dealing with regret and  ultimately  finding redemption  
59676,a humorless 
59677,provides the drama that gives added clout to this doc 
59678,no one can hear you snore 
59679,sucks  but 
59680,that transforms this story about love and culture into a cinematic poem 
59681,the script carries arnold  and the viewers  into the forbidden zone of sympathizing with terrorist motivations by presenting the  other side of the story   
59682,he s just a sad aristocrat in tattered finery 
59683,spiritless  silly and monotonous

59685,main asset 
59686,just two 
59687,beautifully shot  delicately scored and powered by a set of heartfelt performances 
59688,a long  unfunny one 
59689,with the surface histrionics failing to compensate for the paperthin characterizations and facile situations 
59690,far the worst movie of the year 
59691,lowbudget 
59692,powerfully drawn toward the light  the light of the exit sign 
59693,yes  spirited away is a triumph of imagination  but it s also a failure of storytelling  
59694,good performances keep it from being a total rehash  
59695,spielberg s first real masterpiece  it deserved all the hearts it won  and wins still  20 years later  
59696,s rare to see a movie that takes such a speedy swan dive from  promising  to  interesting  to  familiar  before landing squarely on  stupid

59702,transported into the life of wladyslaw szpilman  who is not only a pianist  but a good human being 
59703,sadly  though many of the actors throw off a spark or two when they first appear  they ca nt generate enough heat in this cold vacuum of a comedy to start a reaction  
59704,are both overplayed and exaggerated 
59705,the rock is destined to be the 21st century s new  conan  and that he s going to make a splash even greater than arnold schwarzenegger  jeanclaud van damme or steven segal  
59706,that few movies are able to accomplish 
59707,the beaten path  not necessarily for the better 
59708,a deeply humanistic artist who  in spite of all that he s witnessed  remains surprisingly idealistic 
59709,getting there is not even half the interest  
59710,favorably 
59711,this mildmannered farce  directed by one of its writers  john c walsh  is corny in a way that bespeaks an expiration date passed a long time ago  
59712,had more interesting  and  dare i say  thematically complex  bowel movements than this longontheshelf  pointandshoot exercise in gimmicky crime drama

59720,into a gutwrenching examination of the way cultural differences and emotional expectations collide 
59721,lacks the spirit of the previous two  
59722,are so few films about the plight of american indians in modern america that skins comes as a welcome  if downbeat  missive from a forgotten front 
59723,ten little indians meets friday the 13th by way of clean and sober  filmed on the set of carpenter s the thing and loaded with actors you re most likely to find on the next inevitable incarnation of the love boat 
59724, synthetic  is the best description of this wellmeaning  beautifully produced film that sacrifices its promise for a highpowered star pedigree  
59725,a bloated plot 
59726,classic theater piece 
59727,my only complaint 
59728,to dupe the viewer into taking it all as very important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a hollywood product 
59729,you can do no wrong with jason x 
59730,s still entertaining to watch the target practice  
59731,a vh1 behind the music special that has something a little more special behind it  music that did nt sell many records but helped change a nation

59733,an elegant visual sense and a talent 
59734, consistently funny  
59735,buried somewhere inside its fabric  but never clearly seen or 
59736,the film has a laundry list of minor shortcomings 
59737,to be a breath of fresh air 
59738,tries too hard 
59739,is unfocused  while the story goes nowhere  
59740,fails to give his audience a single character worth rooting for  or worth rooting against  for that matter  
59741,everybody loves a david and goliath story 
59742,a lame romantic comedy 
59743,the movie bogs down in rhetoric and cliché  
59744,the writing is indifferent 
59745,will probably like it  
59746,of his topnotch creative team 
59747,when it s not wallowing in hormonal melodrama 
59748,needlessly poor quality

59778,are no less a menace to society than the film s characters

59780,absorbing movie 
59781,a well paced and satisfying little drama that deserved better than a  directtovideo  release

59789,beneath the uncanny  inevitable and seemingly shrewd facade of moviebiz farce  lies a plot cobbled together from largely flat and uncreative moments  
59790,it s a boring movie about a boring man  made watchable by a bravura performance from a consummate actor incapable of being boring

59849,uneven  selfconscious but often hilarious spoof  
59850,a zany mix of saturday night livestyle parody  70s blaxploitation films and goofball action comedy gone wild

59857,charming but slight comedy 
59858,to rescue me from a summer of teendriven  toilethumor codswallop 
59859,tell you how tedious  how resolutely unamusing  how thoroughly unrewarding all of this is  and what a reckless squandering of four fine acting talents

59879,while somewhat less than it might have been  the film is a good one  and you ve got to hand it to director george clooney for biting off such a big job the first time out  
59880,bloodsucker computer effects 
59881,the film is a hilarious adventure and 
59882,is undone by anachronistic quick edits and occasional jarring glimpses of a modern theater audience watching the events unfold

60318,maryam is a small film  but it offers large rewards  
60319,the familiar topic of office politics 
60320,s all surface psychodramatics 
60321,not only learning but inventing a remarkable new trick 
60322,because it echoes the by now intolerable morbidity of so many recent movies 
60323,is unashamedly proserbian and makes little attempt to give voice to the other side  
60324,s not particularly well made 
60325,directing with a sure and measured hand   haneke  steers clear of the sensational and offers instead an unflinching and objective look at a decidedly perverse pathology  
60326,beautifully read and  finally  deeply humanizing 
60327,since freddy got fingered 
60328,shallow  noisy and pretentious  
60329,the viewer s patience 
60330,rich promise 
60331,anarchist maxim 
60332,is long on 
60333,two fine actors  morgan freeman and 
60334,rarely does such highprofile talent serve such literate material  
60335,the leads are natural and lovely 
60336,hampered by its predictable plot and paperthin supporting characters 
60337,once overly oldfashioned in its sudsy plotting 
60338,that this should seal the deal 
60339,high crimes carries almost no organic intrigue as a government  marinelegal mystery 
60340,is so intent on hammering home his message that he forgets to make it entertaining  
60341,an unbalanced mixture 
60342, the movie completely transfixes the audience  
60343,nights feels more like a quickie tv special than a feature film  it s not even a tv special you d bother watching past the second commercial break 
60344,on top of a foundering performance 
60345,wasting 
60346,by the incredibly flexible cast 
60347,it is just too bad the film s story does not live up to its style  
60348,fail to generate any interest in an unsympathetic hero caught up in an intricate plot that while cleverly worked out  can not overcome blah characters 
60349,make a nice coffee table book 
60350,ends so horrendously confusing 
60351,golden book 
60352,so farfetched it would be impossible to believe if it were nt true 
60353,simpleminded and 
60354,alert  if not 
60355,is sordid and disgusting 
60356,the incessant use 
60357,the same way you came  a few tasty morsels under your belt  but no new friends 
60358,it is not the first time that director sara sugarman stoops to having characters drop their pants for laughs and not the last time she fails to provoke them  
60359,nothing about them is attractive  
60360,the performers are so spot on 
60361,its appeal will probably limited to lds church members and undemanding armchair tourists  
60362,a film less 
60363,a lovely film for the holiday season 
60364,the increasingly diverse french director has created a film that one can honestly describe as looking  sounding and simply feeling like no other film in recent history  
60365,urge to grab the old lady at the end of my aisle s walker and toss it at the screen in frustration 
60366,a headturner  thoughtfully written 
60367,the comedy equivalent 
60368,through with originality  humor and pathos 
60369,of this unique director s previous films 
60370,some outrageously creative action 
60371,a squirminducing fishoutofwater formula that goes nowhere and goes there very  very slowly 
60372,pushes all the demographically appropriate comic buttons 
60373,combined with stunning animation 
60374,cranky 
60375,become one of our best actors 
60376, carvey s  characters are both overplayed and exaggerated  but then again  subtlety has never been his trademark  
60377,every frame of this stylish film that is able to visualize schizophrenia but is still confident enough to step back and look at the sick character with a sane eye 
60378,the most beautiful  evocative works i ve seen 
60379,unfortunately  kapur modernizes aew mason s story to suit the sensibilities of a young american  a decision that plucks  the four feathers  bare  
60380,hashiguchi uses the situation to evoke a japan bustling atop an undercurrent of loneliness and isolation  
60381,a nicely understated expression of the grief 
60382,the relationship between reluctant 
60383,is undone by a filmmaking methodology that s just experimental enough to alienate the mainstream audience while ringing cliched to hardened indieheads 
60384,much of all about lily chouchou is mesmerizing 
60385,always entertaining  and smartly written 
60386,an adoring  widesmiling reception 
60387,is authentic 
60388,i would recommend big bad love only to winger fans who have missed her since 1995 s forget paris  
60389,is about quiet  decisive moments between members of the cultural elite as they determine how to proceed as the world implodes  
60390,enough to sit through crap like this 
60391,a little scattered 
60392,ignored it in favor of old  juvenile delinquent  paperbacks with titles 
60393,made fresh by an intelligent screenplay and gripping performances 
60394,it s a ripper of a yarn 
60395,the soundtrack alone is worth the price of admission  
60396,indepth portrait 
60397,entertaining and suggestive 
60398,the demons of his own fear and paranoia 
60399,at the very least 
60400,intermittently powerful study 
60401,you ll enjoy the hot chick  
60402,racist portraits 
60403,creating an intriguing species of artifice 
60404,by the sea would slip under the waves  
60405,i thought the relationships were wonderful  the comedy was funny  and the love  real  
60406,has really done his subject justice  
60407,if there was ever a movie where the upbeat ending feels like a copout 
60408,misses a major opportunity to be truly revelatory about his psyche  
60409,not since ghostbusters has a film used manhattan s architecture in such a gloriously goofy way  
60410,to a t 
60411,cloaks a familiar antifeminist equation  career  kids  misery  in tiresome romanticcomedy duds  
60412,male hip hop fantasy 
60413,becomes a questionable kind of inexcusable dumb innocence 
60414,bible stores of the potential for sanctimoniousness  making them meaningful for both kids and churchwary adults 
60415,a great yarn 
60416,rooted 
60417,soderbergh s best films   erin brockovich    out of sight  and  ocean s eleven   
60418,s surprisingly bland despite the heavy doses of weird performances and direction 
60419,sweetness and vulnerability 
60420,the muckraking  soulsearching spirit 
60421, it s badder than bad  
60422,offers a trenchant critique of capitalism 
60423,wellpaced and ultimately 
60424,stellar performance 
60425,best disney movie 
60426,flows forwards and back  weaving themes among three strands which allow us to view events as if through a prism 
60427,cardboard characters and performers 
60428,will have fun with 
60429,this crude  this fastpaced and this insane 
60430,will eat up like so much gelati 
60431,especially give credit to affleck  
60432,the movie contains no wit  only labored gags  
60433,been this disappointed by a movie in a long time 
60434,inevitable and 
60435,the cleverest  
60436,an interesting bit of speculation 
60437,feel better already  
60438,its leaden acting 
60439,teensleaze equivalent 
60440,from being a complete waste of time 
60441,is like a year late for tapping into our reality tv obsession  and even tardier for exploiting the novelty of the  webcast   
60442,as the direction is intelligently accomplished 
60443,but no   
60444,s a pretty woman 
60445,s low on both suspense and payoff 
60446,franco is an excellent choice for the walledoff but combustible hustler  
60447,good actors have a radar for juicy roles  there s a plethora of characters in this picture  and not one of them is flat 
60448,fumbles away 
60449, overlong soap 
60450,a tremendous  offbeat sense of style and humor 
60451,miller eloquently captures the moment when a woman s life  out of a deepseated  emotional need  is about to turn onto a different path  
60452,to swallow thanks to remarkable performances by ferrera and ontiveros 
60453,seems as deflated as he does 
60454,dumb gags 
60455,a spooky yarn of demonic doings on the high seas that works better the less the brain is engaged 
60456,several strong performances 
60457,harmless 
60458,a lot of problems 
60459,congrats disney 
60460,the film has an odd purity that does nt bring you into the characters so much as it has you study them  
60461,is the awkwardly paced soap operaish story 
60462, it s kinda dumb  
60463,reminds us that  in any language  the huge stuff in life can usually be traced back to the little things 
60464,in a slaphappy mood 
60465,a sly female empowerment movie 
60466,half the excitement of balto 
60467,updating white s dry wit to a new age 
60468,the movie spends more time with schneider than with newcomer mcadams  even though her performance is more interesting  and funnier  than his  
60469,dismiss 
60470,rehashes several old themes and is capped with pointless extremes 
60471,take the warning literally 
60472,a thriller 
60473,particular new yorkers deeply touched by an unprecedented tragedy 
60474,energy and geniality to please not only the fanatical adherents on either side  but also people who know nothing about the subject and think they re not interested  
60475,from 
60476,on no level whatsoever for me 
60477,consistently funny 
60478,equally engrossing 
60479,looks and feels tired 
60480,a reasonable degree of suspense 
60481,turns a potentially interesting idea into an excruciating film 
60482,a brief amount 
60483,a heaven 
60484,to create a film that s not merely about kicking undead   but also about dealing with regret and  ultimately  finding redemption 
60485,is like a beautiful food entrée that is nt heated properly  so that it ends up a bit cold and relatively flavorless 
60486,quiet  introspective and entertaining 
60487,a bangup job of pleasing the crowds 
60488,seems content to dogpaddle in the mediocre end of the pool  
60489,opening up 
60490,told just proficiently enough to trounce its overly comfortable trappings  
60491,is an action movie with an action icon who s been all but decommissioned 
60492,to stop watching 
60493,softheaded metaphysical claptrap 
60494,who paid to see it 
60495,less than fresh 
60496,a triumph  a film that hews out a world and carries us effortlessly from darkness to light 
60497,you ll find it with ring  an indisputably spooky film  with a screenplay to die for 
60498,rarely  a movie is more than a movie  
60499,we ve liked klein s other work but rollerball left us cold 
60500,to see a movie that embraces its oldfashioned themes and in the process comes out looking like something wholly original 
60501,the performers are so spot on  it is hard to conceive anyone else in their roles  
60502,offend viewers not amused by the sick sense of humor  
60503,an incredibly irritating comedy about thoroughly vacuous people 
60504,a seriocomic debut of extravagant promise by georgianisraeli director dover kosashvili  
60505,an overly sillified plot and 
60506,becomes long and tedious 
60507,are never more than sketches  which leaves any true emotional connection or identification frustratingly out of reach  
60508,intermittently wise 
60509,some writer dude  i think his name was  uh  michael zaidan  was supposed to have like written the screenplay or something  but  dude  
60510,writer and director otar iosseliani s pleasant tale 
60511,is simply a wellmade and satisfying thriller  
60512,is carried less by wow factors than by its funny  moving yarn that holds up well after two decades  
60513,a hilarious ode to middle america 
60514,the funniest jokes of any movie 
60515,derailed 
60516,the problem with wendigo  for all its effective moments  is nt really one of resources  
60517,animation work 
60518,i found it weirdly appealing 
60519,do justice 
60520,is extremely funny 
60521,inconsequential roadandbuddy pic 
60522,that is fully formed and remarkably assured 
60523, you discover that the answer is as conventional as can be  
60524,peels layers 
60525,nighttime manhattan  a loquacious videologue of the modern male and the lengths to which he ll go to weave a protective cocoon around his own ego 
60526,bloody 
60527,are very  very good reasons for certain movies to be sealed in a jar and left on a remote shelf indefinitely 
60528,strong filmmaking requires a clear sense of purpose  and in that ohsoimportant category  the four feathers comes up short  
60529,in tired stereotypes 
60530,so perfect for a ballplayer 
60531,wise 
60532,when the fire burns out  we ve only come facetoface with a couple dragons and that s where the film ultimately fails 
60533,imaginary 
60534,this film has an  a  list cast and some strong supporting players 
60535,flawed humanity 
60536,ame and unnecessary  
60537,watch robert deniro belt out  when you re a jet 
60538,is nt just 
60539,the long and eventful spiritual journey of the guru who helped 
60540,a great writer 
60541,messy  uncouth  incomprehensible  vicious and absurd 
60542,though an important political documentary  this does not really make the case the kissinger should be tried as a war criminal  
60543,the chaotic horror 
60544,the directing and story are disjointed  flaws that have to be laid squarely on taylor s doorstep  
60545,full of cheesy dialogue  but great trashy fun that finally returns de palma to his pulpy thrillers of the early 80s 
60546,record the lives of women torn apart by a legacy of abuse 
60547,by humanity s greatest shame 
60548,plays like a glossy melodrama that occasionally verges on camp  
60549,incredibly flexible cast 
60550,is a smart movie that knows its classical music  knows its freud and knows its sade  
60551,tanks  
60552,corrupt 
60553,romething s really wrong with this ricture  
60554,really strong second effort 
60555,you want to bang your head on the seat in front of you  at its cluelessness  at its idiocy  at its utterly misplaced earnestness 
60556,of french cinema s master craftsmen 
60557,i would have liked it much more if harry  tonto never existed 
60558,grinds itself 
60559,all the way to the credits 
60560,a winning comedy with its wry observations 
60561,the most screwy thing here is how so many talented people were convinced to waste their time 
60562,awarded mythic status 
60563,tambor and clayburgh make an appealing couple  he s understated and sardonic  she s appealingly manic and energetic  
60564, very good 
60565,fun with it all 
60566, thoughtful  unapologetically raw 
60567,this film always keeping the balance between the fantastic and the believable 
60568,much has been written about those years when the psychedelic 60s grooved over into the gay 70s  but words do nt really do the era justice  
60569,has performed a difficult task indeed 
60570,consider what new best friend does not have  beginning with the minor omission of a screenplay  
60571,repetitious 
60572,a freedom 
60573,as a treatise on spirituality as well as a solid scifi thriller 
60574,with lingering questions about what the film is really getting at 
60575,jacobi  the most fluent of actors  
60576,powerful and reasonably fulfilling 
60577,is driven by appealing leads 
60578,a halfwit plot 
60579,all too familiar  
60580,in selfconsciously flashy camera effects  droning house music and flat  flat dialogue 
60581,a mess from start to finish 
60582,a teenybopper ed wood film  replete with the pubescent scandalous innuendo and the highstrung but flaccid drama 
60583,hide a weak script 
60584, dogtown and zboys has a compelling story to tell  
60585,abject 
60586,the director taking a handsoff approach when he should have shaped the story to show us why it s compelling 
60587,decisive 
60588,adobo 
60589,they grow up and you can wait till then 
60590,some movies were made for the big screen  some for the small screen

60597,breathe out of every frame 
60598,as a remake  it s a pale imitation  
60599,expect and often surprises you with unexpected comedy 
60600,has a cinematic fluidity and sense of intelligence that makes it work more than it probably should 
60601,notable 
60602,breezy movie 
60603,the first hour is tedious though ford and neeson capably hold our interest  but its just not a thrilling movie  
60604,things really get weird  though not particularly scary  the movie is all portent and no content 
60605,terrifically entertaining 
60606,charms are immediately apparent 
60607,a comingofage movie that hollywood would nt have the guts to make  
60608,robust 
60609,because of its heightened  wellshaped dramas 
60610,looks genuinely pretty 
60611,elegantly appointed 
60612,s a piece of handiwork that shows its indie tatters and selfconscious seams in places  but has some quietly moving moments and an intelligent subtlety 
60613,fascinating they may be as history 
60614,winning and wildly fascinating work 
60615,s  worth the extra effort to see an artist  still committed to growth in his ninth decade  change while remaining true to his principles with a film whose very subject is  quite pointedly  about the peril of such efforts  
60616,a long patch of black ice 
60617,odd and weird 
60618,this oscarnominated documentary 
60619,too burdened by the actor 
60620,give the movie points for 
60621,that only ever walked the delicate tightrope between farcical and loathsome 
60622,see clockstoppers if you have nothing better to do with 94 minutes  
60623,of an artist  one whose view of america  history and the awkwardness of human life is generous and deep 
60624,thumbs up to paxton for not falling into the hollywood trap and making a vanity project with nothing new to offer 
60625,bloated 
60626,its characters  about whose fate it is hard to care 
60627,intelligent and 
60628,an elegantly balanced movie  every member of the ensemble has something fascinating to do  
60629,to the endlessly repetitive scenes of embarrassment 
60630,turn on many people to opera 
60631,ararat is fiercely intelligent and uncommonly ambitious  
60632,substandard 
60633,the characters are so generic and 
60634,director hoffman  with great help from kevin kline  
60635,eventually resents having to inhale this gutter romancer s secondhand material 
60636,a tremendous  offbeat sense 
60637,with taking insane liberties and doing the goofiest stuff out of left field 
60638,the first fatal attraction was vile enough  
60639,to be dismissed 
60640,ridiculous action sequences 
60641,in a badmovie way 
60642,written by somebody else 
60643,loses its overall sense of mystery 
60644,mostly told through oncamera interviews with several survivors  whose riveting memories are rendered with such clarity that it s as if it all happened only yesterday 
60645,of the better videogamebased flicks  
60646,real shame 
60647,often incisive satire and unabashed sweetness 
60648,its filmmakers run out of clever ideas and visual gags about halfway through 
60649,attal s hangups surrounding infidelity are so oldfashioned and  dare i say  
60650,lowbrow 
60651,is phenomenal  especially the women  
60652,whimsical humor 
60653,that makes the banger sisters a fascinating character study with laughs to spare 
60654,positive change 
60655,obsessive 
60656,hilariously raunchy as south park 
60657,lacks the wit necessary to fully exploit the comic elements of the premise  making the proceedings more bizarre than actually amusing 
60658,new energy 
60659,is farflung  illogical  and plain stupid 
60660,would be rendered tedious by avary s failure to construct a story with even a trace of dramatic interest  
60661,has a difficult time shaking its blair witch project realtime roots 
60662, kapur gives us episodic choppiness  undermining the story s emotional thrust  
60663,even when there are lulls  the emotions seem authentic  and the picture is so lovely toward the end 
60664,oftentimes funny  
60665,i do nt know what she s doing in here 
60666,great fun 
60667,the qualities that made the first film so special 
60668,that s just experimental enough to alienate the mainstream audience while ringing cliched to hardened indieheads 
60669,do a load of good 
60670,drumline is its energy 
60671,is dicaprio s best performance in anything ever  and easily the most watchable film of the year  
60672,wellpaced 
60673,he has something significant to say 
60674,brian tufano s handsome widescreen photography 
60675,horribly depressing and 
60676,ultimately this is a frustrating patchwork  an uneasy marriage of louis begley s source novel  about schmidt  and an old payne screenplay  
60677,a strong erotic spark to the most crucial lipreading sequence 
60678, steven shainberg s adaptation of mary gaitskill s harrowing short story  is a brilliantly played  deeply unsettling experience  
60679,like showgirls and glitter  the most entertaining moments here are unintentional  
60680,laugther 
60681,be a tossup between presiding over the end of cinema as we know it and another night of delightful hand shadows 
60682, this is one of the bestsustained ideas i have ever seen on the screen  
60683,is nt as funny as you d hoped  
60684,as a good oldfashioned adventure for kids  spirit  stallion of the cimarron is a winner  
60685,bitter and less mature 
60686,it s easier to change the sheets than to change hackneyed concepts when it comes to dreaming up romantic comedies 
60687,suggest possibilities which imbue the theme with added depth and resonance 
60688,the occasional belly laugh 
60689,shows uncanny skill in getting under the skin of her characters 
60690,spreads itself too thin  leaving these actors  as well as the members of the commune 
60691,while certainly clever in spots 
60692,to accommodate to fit in and gain the unconditional love she seeks 
60693,gives this aging series a much needed kick  making  die another day  one of the most entertaining bonds in years 
60694,evocative 
60695,i do nt know if frailty will turn bill paxton into an alist director  but he can rest contentedly with the knowledge that he s made at least one damn fine horror movie  
60696,where nothing really happens 
60697,worthy of our respect 
60698,successfully 
60699,has a florid turn of phrase that owes more to guy ritchie than the bard of avon 
60700,advised to sit near the back and squint to avoid noticing some truly egregious lipnonsynching 
60701,between these two marginal characters 
60702,they so heartwarmingly motivate 
60703,carries a little too much ai nt  shecute baggage into her lead role as a troubled and determined homicide cop to quite pull off the heavy stuff  
60704,a sensitive  modest comic tragedy that works as both character study and symbolic examination of the huge economic changes sweeping modern china 
60705,rising star jake gyllenhaal 
60706,that suffers because of its many excesses 
60707,griffiths  warm and winning central performance 
60708,he s just a sad aristocrat in tattered finery  and the film seems as deflated as he does 
60709,a plodding teen remake that s so mechanical you can smell the grease on the plot 
60710,a truly largerthanlife character 
60711,actionpacked an experience as a ringside seat at a toughman contest 
60712,o fantasma is boldly  confidently orchestrated  aesthetically and sexually  and 
60713,seeing things from new sides  plunging deeper  
60714,here s a case of two actors who do everything humanly possible to create characters who are sweet and believable  and are defeated by a screenplay that forces them into bizarre  implausible behavior  
60715,as pure composition and form

60971,morality  family  and social expectation 
60972,an undeniably moving film to experience  and ultimately that s what makes it worth a recommendation 
60973,as it sounds  but strikes a tone that s alternately melancholic  hopeful and strangely funny 
60974,what it would be like to be smack in the middle of a war zone armed with nothing but a camera 
60975,a smorgasbord of soliloquies about nothing delivered by the former mr drew barrymore 
60976,in the hands of a brutally honest individual like prophet jack 
60977,is as bad as you think  and worse than you can imagine

60986,embarrassed to be part of 
60987,gets vivid  convincing performances from a fine cast  and generally keeps things going at a rapid pace  occasionally using an omniscient voiceover narrator in the manner of french new wave films

61930,anachronistic quick edits and 
61931,laughs that may make you hate yourself for giving in 
61932,complicated enough to let you bask in your own cleverness as you figure it out 
61933,these guys seem great to knock back a beer with but they re simply not funny performers  
61934,the film never recovers from the clumsy cliché of the ugly american abroad  and 
61935,makes it attractive throughout 
61936,like a promising workinprogress 
61937,most breezy movie steven spielberg 
61938,intellectual lector in contemplation of the auteur s professional injuries

61951,enjoy yourselves 
61952,with nervous energy  moral ambiguity and great uncertainties 
61953,to work in the same vein as the brilliance of animal house 
61954,it is different from others in its genre in that it is does not rely on dumb gags  anatomical humor  or character cliches 
61955,than its exploitive array of obligatory cheap 
61956, lushly photographed and beautifully recorded  
61957,the awe in which it holds itself 
61958,to build a feelgood fantasy around a vain dictatormadman is offputting  to say the least  not to mention inappropriate and wildly undeserved  
61959,firstclass  natural acting and a look at  the real americans  
61960,a journey spanning nearly three decades of bittersweet camaraderie and history  in which we feel that we truly know what makes holly and marina tick  
61961,this much imagination 
61962,brings an irresistible blend of warmth and humor and a consistent embracing humanity in the face of life s harshness 
61963,of the acting breed 
61964,does nt quite get there 
61965,m convinced i could keep a family of five blind  crippled  amish people alive in this situation better than these british soldiers do at keeping themselves kicking

61971,dramatic  funny and poignant 
61972,divine monument 
61973,this may be the first cartoon ever to look as if it were being shown on the projection television screen of a sports bar

61975,peppered with false starts and 
61976,by talented writerdirector anderson 
61977,accomplished 
61978,knockaround 
61979,the movie s somethingborrowed construction feels less the product of loving  well integrated homage and more like a mere excuse for the wan  thinly sketched story  
61980,rely on an ambiguous presentation 
61981,s a lot richer than the ones hollywood action screenwriters usually come up with on their own 
61982,though a morbid one 
61983,nothing delivered by the former mr drew barrymore 
61984,he has a great cast and a great idea  
61985,all the pieces fall together without much surprise  but little moments give it a boost  
61986,laughter and selfexploitation merge into jolly softporn em powerment

61998,the plan to make enough into  an inspiring tale of survival wrapped in the heartpounding suspense of a stylish psychological thriller  has flopped as surely as a soufflé gone wrong  
61999,although it tries to be much more  it s really just another major league  
62000,a social injustice  at least 
62001,if you love reading andor poetry  then by all means check it out  
62002,if the film fails to fulfill its own ambitious goals  it nonetheless sustains interest during the long buildup of expository material  
62003,there s an admirable rigor to jimmy s relentless anger  and to the script s refusal of a happy ending  but 
62004,taken quite a nosedive from alfred hitchcock s imaginative flight to shyamalan s selfimportant summer fluff 
62005,serves as a paper skeleton for some very good acting  dialogue  comedy  direction and especially charm 
62006,to be something of a sitcom apparatus 
62007,than a worthwhile effort 
62008,you could hate it for the same reason  
62009,just a string of stale gags  with no good inside dope  and no particular bite  
62010,broken character study

62041,an oldfashioned but emotionally stirring adventure tale 
62042,it s a rocksolid little genre picture 
62043,what saves this deeply affecting film from being merely a collection of wrenching cases is corcuera s attention to detail  
62044,one lousy movie

62046,make several runs to the concession stand andor restroom and not 
62047,cheapshot 
62048,s barely shocking  barely interesting and most of all  barely anything 
62049,spicy footnote 
62050,the filmmakers have made every effort to disguise it as an unimaginative screenwriter s invention 
62051,astonishingly vivid 
62052,particular  anciently demanding métier 
62053,sticky and unsatisfied 
62054,whose achievements  and complexities  reached far beyond the end zone

62059,every bit as fascinating 
62060,i realized the harsh reality of my situation 
62061,so much that this arrogant richard pryor wannabe s routine is offensive  puerile and unimaginatively foulmouthed if it was at least funny

62063,are immaculate  with roussillon providing comic relief  
62064,engages us in constant fits of laughter  until we find ourselves surprised at how much we care about the story  and 
62065, not to mention mysterious  sensual  emotionally intense  and replete with virtuoso throatsinging  
62066,nothing more than an hourandahalflong commercial for britney s latest album 
62067,all ages  a movie that will make you laugh 
62068,harps on mediaconstructed  issues  
62069,it s both degrading and strangely liberating to see people working so hard at leading lives of sexy intrigue  only to be revealed by the dispassionate gantz brothers as ordinary  pasty lumpen  
62070,has never made a more sheerly beautiful film than this unexpectedly moving meditation on love  history  memory  resistance and artistic transcendence 
62071,the actors are simply too good  and 
62072,stains 
62073,flopped as surely as a soufflé gone wrong 
62074,some of the visual flourishes are a little too obvious  but restrained and subtle storytelling  and fine performances make this delicate comingofage tale a treat  
62075,effecting change 
62076,a remarkable film that explores the monster s psychology not in order to excuse him but rather to demonstrate that his pathology evolved from human impulses that grew hideously twisted 
62077,rich visual clarity and deeply 
62078,have an honesty and dignity that breaks your heart  
62079,indeed  the more outrageous bits achieve a shockyouintolaughter intensity of almost dadaist proportions  
62080, why should you buy the movie milk when the tv cow is free  
62081,such unrelenting dickensian decency that it turned me 
62082,no clue 
62083, it ultimately comes off as a pale successor  
62084,the movie turns out to be  assayas   homage to the gallic  tradition of quality   in all its fusty squareness  
62085,you doze off thirty minutes into the film 
62086,a sense of good intentions derailed by a failure to seek and strike just the right tone 
62087,little visible talent and no energy 
62088,to have you leaving the theater with a smile on your face 
62089,hoffman waits too long to turn his movie in an unexpected direction  and 
62090,is pretty damned funny

62329,the film s lack of personality permeates all its aspects  from the tv movieesque  affected child acting to the dullest irish pub scenes ever filmed  
62330,is by far the worst movie of the year  
62331,repellantly out of control 
62332,as wellwritten as sexy beast  not as gloriously flippant as lock  stock and two smoking barrels  but stylish and moody and exceptionally wellacted

62449,frank capra played this story straight  
62450,as a clever exercise in neohitchcockianism 
62451,boldly stroked  luridly colored  unidimensional nonsense machine that strokes the eyeballs while it evaporates like so much crypt mist in the brain

62458,the film s story does not live up to its style 
62459,has rewards  from the exoticism of its seas of sand to the fierce grandeur of its sweeping battle scenes  
62460,it might be  easier  to watch on video at home  but that should nt stop diehard french film connoisseurs from going out and enjoying the bigscreen experience  
62461,delectable 
62462,there s too much forced drama in this wildly uneven movie  about a young man s battle with his inescapable past and uncertain future in a very shapable but largely unfulfilling present  
62463,does nt even in passing mention political prisoners  poverty and the boat loads of people who try to escape the country 
62464,so bland that even as rogue cia assassins working for chris cooper s agency boss close in on the resourceful amnesiac  we do nt feel much for damonbourne or his predicament

62492,a perfectly rendered period piece 
62493,thriller as lazy 
62494, slow and dreary

63151,deeply meditative 
63152,have ever seen  constantly pulling the rug from underneath us  seeing things from new sides  plunging deeper  getting more intense

63180,look down on their workingclass subjects from their lofty perch  that finally makes sex with strangers  which opens today in the new york metropolitan area  so distasteful 
63181,such a great one 
63182, you re definitely convinced that these women are spectacular  
63183,and not in a good way

63191,certainly hard to hate 
63192,ll feel as the credits roll

63195,zings along with vibrance and warmth 
63196,playfully profound 
63197, you might be wishing for a watch that makes time go faster rather than the other way around  
63198, this sad  occasionally horrifying but often inspiring film is among wiseman s warmest  
63199,as exciting to watch as two lastplace basketball 
63200,the distance 
63201,inhabit their world without cleaving to a narrative arc 
63202,without intent 
63203,an actionthriller of the finest kind  evoking memories of day of the jackal  the french connection  and heat  
63204,forced drama in this wildly uneven movie

63208,detention 
63209,is a nosurprise series of explosions and violence while banderas looks like he s not trying to laugh at how bad 
63210,even as the hero of the story rediscovers his passion in life  the mood remains oddly detached

63224,this stuck pig of a movie 
63225,otherwise comic 
63226, while the last metro  was more melodramatic  confined to a single theater company and its strategies and deceptions  while tavernier is more concerned with the entire period of history  
63227,rejected xfiles episode 
63228,it can be a bit repetitive 
63229,it suffers from the awkwardness that results from adhering to the messiness of true stories  
63230,looks as if it were made by a highly gifted 12yearold instead of a grown man 
63231,that you can not believe anyone more central to the creation of bugsy than the caterer 
63232,as darkly funny  energetic  and surprisingly gentle 
63233,is to frighten and disturb 
63234,especially when i have to put up with 146 minutes of it 
63235,left a few crucial things out  
63236,sirk 
63237,may well be the only one laughing at his own joke 
63238,littered with celluloid garbage 
63239,covers huge  heavy topics in a bland  surfacey way that does nt offer any insight into why  for instance  good things happen to bad people  
63240,flatout amusing  sometimes endearing and often fabulous  with a solid cast  noteworthy characters  
63241,which may not be cuttingedge indie filmmaking 
63242,the dialogue sounds like horrible poetry  
63243,a delightful little film that revels in its own simplicity  mostly martha will leave you with a smile on your face and a grumble in your stomach  
63244,of interest 
63245,a formula comedy 
63246, giggly little story 
63247,lucas has in fact come closer than anyone could desire to the cheap  graceless  hackneyed scifi serials of the 30s and 40s  
63248,a children s film in the truest sense 
63249,the merits of fighting hard for something that really matters 
63250,rotting

63252,glizty 
63253,s as good as you remember 
63254,is to see two academy award winning actresses  and one academy award winning actor  succumb to appearing in this junk that s tv sitcom material at best 
63255,dreary 
63256,you ca nt wait to see end  
63257,the story itself is actually quite vapid  
63258,brazen enough to attempt to pass this stinker off as a scary movie 
63259,an irresistibly uncanny ambience 
63260,your own mystery science theatre 3000 tribute 
63261,successful at lodging itself in the brain 
63262,until you feel fully embraced by this gentle comedy 
63263,reveals how important our special talents can be when put in service of of others 
63264,much of the digitally altered footage appears jagged  as if filmed directly from a television monitor  while the extensive use of stock footage quickly becomes a tiresome cliché  
63265,like its parade of predecessors  this halloween is a gory slashfest  
63266,bisset is both convincing and radiant 
63267,an enormously entertaining movie  like nothing we ve ever seen before  and yet completely familiar  
63268,everybody else is in the background 
63269,nothing but boilerplate clichés 
63270,enter 
63271,some of the characters die and others do nt  and the film pretends that those living have learned some sort of lesson  and  really  nobody in the viewing audience cares  
63272,breathes life 
63273,stylish psychological thriller 
63274,starts as a tart little lemon drop of a movie and 
63275,moved to the edge of their seats 
63276,is hard to conceive anyone else in their roles 
63277,high production values 
63278,particularly nightmarish 
63279,and utterly pointless 
63280,quickly losing its focus  point and purpose in a mess of mixed messages  overblown drama and bruce willis with a scar 
63281,gifted artists 
63282,forces them into bizarre  implausible behavior 
63283,sacrificing the integrity of the opera 
63284,ultimately very satisfying 
63285,about this latest reincarnation of the world s greatest teacher 
63286,of sharp writing 
63287,a welcome  if downbeat  missive from a forgotten front 
63288,mixed messages  overblown drama and bruce willis 
63289,is rote spookiness  with nary an original idea  or role  or edit  or score  or anything  really  in sight 
63290,the soullessness 
63291,blessed with a searing lead performance by ryan gosling  murder by numbers  
63292,real stars 
63293,the film becomes an overwhelming pleasure  and you find yourself rooting for gai s character to avoid the fate that has befallen every other carmen before her  
63294,carry the film on his admittedly broad shoulders 
63295,as obvious as telling a country skunk 
63296,schaeffer s film never settles into the lightfooted enchantment the material needs  and the characters  quirks and foibles never jell into charm 
63297,have been right at home as a nifty plot line in steven soderbergh s traffic fails to arrive at any satisfying destination 
63298,gets under the skin of a man we only know as an evil  monstrous lunatic 
63299, i suspect  would have a hard time sitting through this one  
63300,stimulating and demanding 
63301,bright and 
63302,a good surprise ending 
63303,a strong first act 
63304,it s unburdened by pretensions to great artistic significance 
63305,and it s what makes their project so interesting 
63306,one oscar nomination 
63307,but they lack their idol s energy and passion for detail  
63308,the atmosphere of the crime expertly 
63309,most poorly staged and 
63310,and unrelentingly exploitative 
63311,director jay russell stomps in hobnail boots over natalie babbitt s gentle  endearing 1975 children s novel  
63312,the enjoyable undercover brother  a zany mix of saturday night livestyle parody  70s blaxploitation films and goofball action comedy gone wild 
63313,there s not a single jumpinyourseat moment and believe it or not  jason actually takes a backseat in his own film to special effects  
63314,nicely 
63315,like a book report 
63316,slog 
63317,so intimate and sensual and funny 
63318,significantly different  and better  
63319,shrill  simple and soapy  
63320,real star 
63321,dead 
63322,an impressive achievement in spite of a river of sadness that pours into every frame 
63323, discontent  and yearning 
63324,has all the enjoyable randomness of a very lively dream and so 
63325,a catalyst for the struggle of black manhood in restrictive and chaotic america  
63326,small gem 
63327,despite the mild hallucinogenic buzz 
63328, gives his best screen performance with an oddly winning portrayal of one of life s ultimate losers  
63329,an excruciating demonstration of the unsalvageability of a movie saddled with an amateurish screenplay 
63330,many conclusive answers in the film 
63331,comes across as lame and sophomoric in this debut indie feature  
63332,it s stylishly directed with verve  
63333,is just too bad the film s story does not live up to its style  
63334,a boring  pretentious muddle that uses a sensational  reallife 19thcentury crime as a metaphor for  
63335,have not been this disappointed by a movie in a long time  
63336,you may feel compelled to watch the film twice or pick up a book on the subject  
63337,sustain interest 
63338,auto focus feels so distant you might as well be watching it through a telescope  
63339,the movie itself is far from disappointing  offering an original take on courtroom movies  a few nifty twists that are so crucial to the genre and another firstrate performance by topbilled star bruce willis  
63340,is a movie that understands characters must come first 
63341,a series of immaculately composed shots of patch adams quietly freaking out does not make for much of a movie  
63342,hugely enjoyable in its own right though not really faithful to 
63343,creepiest conventions 
63344,derivative elements into something that is often quite rich and exciting 
63345,it does nt work  
63346,a family of five blind  crippled  amish people alive in this situation 
63347,both sides of this emotional carwreck 
63348,is emerging in world cinema 
63349,while it may not add up to the sum of its parts 
63350,for all its shootouts  fistfights  and car chases  this movie is a phlegmatic bore  so tedious it makes the silly spy vs spy film the sum of all fears  starring ben affleck  seem downright hitchcockian  
63351,stupid and 
63352,to the point of nausea 
63353,should stick to his day job 
63354,not that funny 
63355,as a retooling of fahrenheit 451  and even as a ripoff of the matrix 
63356, well  
63357,diva 
63358,represents an engaging and intimate first feature 
63359,delicately crafted film 
63360,an uplifting  nearmasterpiece 
63361,mordantly funny 
63362,a wellcrafted film 
63363,anything ever  and easily the most watchable film of the year 
63364,whipsmart 
63365,seems to have been  it s just a kids  flick  
63366,characteristically engorged and sloppy 
63367,jerking off in all its byzantine incarnations to bother pleasuring its audience 
63368,raunch 
63369,for the most part  the film does hold up pretty well  
63370,the finished product s unshapely look 
63371,to sustain a good simmer for most of its running time 
63372,entertains 
63373,cruelly funny 
63374,chore 
63375,lobotomy 
63376,the dream world of teen life 
63377,this mistakenidentity picture is so filmculture referential that the final product is a ghost  
63378,the film would have been more enjoyable had the balance shifted in favor of waterbound action over the landbased  drama  
63379,truly excellent sequences 
63380,it s so successful at lodging itself in the brain 
63381,a bad day 
63382,without any redeeming value whatsoever 
63383,of describing badness 
63384,there s none of the happilyever  after spangle of monsoon wedding in late marriage  and that s part of what makes dover kosashvili s outstanding feature debut so potent 
63385,funniness 
63386,in your heart 
63387,letting you share her oneroom world for a while 
63388,deliciously meanspirited and wryly observant  
63389, they do nt make movies like they used to anymore 
63390,it s usually a bad sign when directors abandon their scripts and go where the moment takes them 
63391,exercise in formula crashandbash action 
63392,otherwise appalling  and downright creepy  
63393,toilet 
63394, sorvino glides gracefully from male persona to female without missing a beat  
63395,standard thriller and drag audience enthusiasm to crush depth 
63396,a bit exploitative but also nicely done  morally alert 
63397,tendentious 
63398,to be cherished 
63399,despite a fairly slow paced  almost humdrum approach to character development  still manages at least a decent attempt at meaningful cinema 
63400,second  what s with all the shooting  
63401,unimpeachable 
63402,stitched together from stock situations and characters 
63403,s a reason why halftime is only fifteen minutes long  
63404,may be burns s strongest film since the brothers mcmullen 
63405,perfect performance 
63406,a james bond series for kids 
63407,s got as potent a topic as ever here 
63408,would do well to cram earplugs in their ears and put pillowcases over their heads for 87 minutes 
63409,satisfyingly 
63410,that it does afford 
63411,the only way to tolerate this insipid  brutally clueless film 
63412,turbulent selfdiscovery 
63413,trotting out threadbare standbys 
63414,does so with an artistry that also smacks of revelation 
63415,lost some of the dramatic conviction that underlies the best of comedies 
63416,this is a very ambitious project for a fairly inexperienced filmmaker  but good actors  good poetry and good music help sustain it 
63417,but also intriguing and honorable  
63418,really need a remake of  charade 
63419,in laramie following the murder of matthew shepard 
63420,s much to recommend the film 
63421,rashomonfordipsticks tale  
63422,as inept 
63423,unassuming  subordinate 
63424,a lovely film  elegant  witty and beneath a prim exterior unabashedly romantic  hugely enjoyable in its own right though not really faithful to its source s complexity  
63425,an artist of 90plus years taking the effort to share his impressions of life and loss and time and art with us 
63426,hossein 
63427,beautifully shot 
63428,is wonderful 
63429,sentimental ooze 
63430,primitive animated special effects 
63431,no explanation or even 
63432,an irresistible blend of warmth and humor

63435,truly wonderful 
63436,strongminded 
63437,into some univaclike script machine

63441,an effective portrait of a life in stasis  
63442,only pain 
63443,somber earnestness in the new adaptation of the cherry orchard 
63444,after a while  hoffman s quirks and mannerisms  particularly his penchant for tearing up on cue  things that seem so real in small doses  become annoying and artificial  
63445,insulting 
63446,a temporal inquiry 
63447,how tedious 
63448,a zombie movie in every sense of the word  mindless  lifeless  meandering  loud  painful  obnoxious  
63449,sufficient 
63450,adrenaline boost 
63451,is so different from the apple and so striking that it can only encourage us to see samira makhmalbaf as a very distinctive sensibility  working to develop her own film language with conspicuous success 
63452,of happy 
63453,the great minds of our times 
63454,mr polanski is in his element here  alone  abandoned  but still consoled by his art  which is more than he has ever revealed before about the source of his spiritual survival  
63455,gives a superb performance 
63456,deny its seriousness and quality 
63457,coldhearted curmudgeon 
63458,feels so distant you might as well be watching it through a telescope 
63459, land beyond time is an enjoyable big movie primarily because australia is a weirdly beautiful place  
63460,heartwarming 
63461,the pain  loneliness and insecurity of the screenwriting process are vividly and painfully brought to slovenly life in this selfdeprecating  biting and witty feature written by charlie kaufman and his twin brother  donald  and directed by spike jonze  
63462,like the hanks character  he s a slow study  the action is stilted and the tabloid energy embalmed  
63463,is scott s convincing portrayal of roger the sad cad that really gives the film its oomph  
63464,watching these eccentrics is both inspiring and pure joy  
63465,a particularly nightmarish fairytale 
63466,something more beautiful than either of those films 
63467,taken outside the context of the current political climate  see  terrorists are more evil than ever   
63468,moving and stark reminder 
63469,do nt really care too much about this love story  
63470,comedy and melodrama 
63471,by turns touching  raucously amusing  uncomfortable  and  yes  even sexy 
63472,its courage  ideas  technical proficiency and great acting 
63473,miscalculates badly 
63474,is notable for its stylistic austerity and forcefulness 
63475,numbing experience 
63476,he respects the material without sentimentalizing it 
63477,a hugely rewarding experience that s every bit as enlightening  insightful and entertaining as grant s two best films  four weddings and a funeral and bridget jones s diary  
63478,of no erotic or sensuous charge 
63479,throwing out so many red herrings  so many false scares  
63480,of shape 
63481,is about quiet  decisive moments between members of the cultural elite as they determine how to proceed as the world implodes 
63482,many flaws 
63483,a superfluous sequel  plagued by that old familiar feeling of  let s get this thing over with   
63484,young romantics 
63485,is a festival film that would have been better off staying on the festival circuit 
63486,ashamed in admitting that my enjoyment came at the expense of seeing justice served  even if it s a dish that s best served cold 
63487,by a set of heartfelt performances 
63488,insurance 
63489,striking villains 
63490,does nt offer audiences any way of gripping what its point is  or even its attitude toward its subject  
63491,much of the lady and the duke is about quiet  decisive moments between members of the cultural elite as they determine how to proceed as the world implodes  
63492,better 
63493,it s often overwritten  with a surfeit of weighty revelations  flowery dialogue  and nostalgia for the past and roads not taken  
63494, you re in luck  
63495,full of cheesy dialogue 
63496,can usually be traced back to the little things 
63497,as clever 
63498,if you like an extreme actionpacked film with a hint of humor 
63499,between deadpan comedy and heartbreaking 
63500,the movie s narrative hook is way too muddled to be an effectively chilling guilty pleasure  
63501,it s an exhilarating place to visit  this laboratory of laughter  
63502,is sickly entertainment at best and minddestroying cinematic pollution at worst  
63503,an almost constant mindset of suspense 
63504,are so oldfashioned 
63505,of admission for the ridicule factor 
63506,skillfully 
63507,flaws  but also 
63508,that examines many different ideas from happiness to guilt in an intriguing bit of storytelling 
63509,one of those films that started with a great premise and then just fell apart  
63510,there would be a tossup between presiding over the end of cinema as we know it and another night of delightful hand shadows  
63511,the secret s eventual discovery 
63512,easier to sit through than most of jaglom s selfconscious and gratingly irritating films 
63513,gives itself the freedom to feel contradictory things  
63514,holds promise  
63515,comes along to remind us of how very bad a motion picture can truly be  
63516,unwieldy cast 
63517,the horror fan

64327,s crap on a leash  far too polite to scale the lunatic heights of joe dante s similarly styled gremlins  
64328,because the movie serves up all of that stuff  nearly subliminally  as the oldhat province of male intrigue 
64329,by no means a slamdunk and sure to ultimately disappoint the action fans who will be moved to the edge of their seats by the dynamic first act  it still comes off as a touching  transcendent love story  
64330,and pretentious endeavor

64337,never fails to fascinate  
64338,all comes down to whether you can tolerate leon barlow  
64339,inventive cinematic tricks and 
64340,the film does nt show enough of the creative process or even of what was created for the nonfan to figure out what makes wilco a big deal  
64341,suffers from its timid parsing of the barnside target of sons trying to breach gaps in their relationships with their fathers  
64342,that pours into every frame 
64343,cultural satire 
64344,enveloping affection 
64345,s as if a bored cage spent the duration of the film s shooting schedule waiting to scream   got aids yet   
64346,this is nt exactly profound cinema

64359,you ll have a good time with this one too 
64360,i m not exactly sure what  and has all the dramatic weight of a raindrop 
64361,of such a well loved classic 
64362,created a substantive movie 
64363, i  t s certainly laudable that the movie deals with hotbutton issues in a comedic context  but barbershop is nt as funny as it should be

64393,intricately structured and wellrealized drama 
64394,so impersonal or 
64395,proves to be a good match of the sensibilities of two directors  
64396,might try paying less attention to the miniseries and more attention to the film it is about 
64397,is clearly a good thing  
64398,thrill you  touch you and make you 
64399,written so well  
64400,undone by a filmmaking methodology that s just experimental enough to alienate the mainstream audience while ringing cliched to hardened indieheads

64408,great deal 
64409,it s goodnatured and sometimes quite funny 
64410,smile 
64411,the movie is like scorsese s mean streets redone by someone who ignored it in favor of old  juvenile delinquent  paperbacks with titles like leather warriors and switchblade sexpot

64461,for the perspective it offers 
64462,even less surprises 
64463,compelling historical tale 
64464,venturesome 
64465,it certainly does nt feel like a film that strays past the two and a half mark

64467,unfocused screenplay

64482,raucously amusing 
64483,marks him as one of the most interesting writerdirectors working today 
64484,seems manufactured to me and artificial

64486,as sexy 
64487,dreary mess 
64488,fun  curiously adolescent movie 
64489,it s a fairly impressive debut from the director  charles stone iii  
64490,your pooperscoopers 
64491, the film s considered approach to its subject matter is too calm and thoughtful for agitprop  and the thinness of its characterizations makes it a failure as straight drama   
64492,while this film has an  a  list cast and some strong supporting players 
64493,comes off as a twoway timeswitching myopic mystery that stalls in its lackluster gear of emotional blandness

64500,despite a fairly slow paced  almost humdrum approach to character development 
64501,it employs changes that fit it well rather than ones that were imposed for the sake of commercial sensibilities 
64502, it s not scary in the slightest  
64503,what s so fun about this silly  outrageous  ingenious thriller 
64504,is both gripping and compelling 
64505,that s right 
64506,epps has neither the charisma nor the natural affability that has made tucker a star  
64507,the saigon of 1952 is an uneasy mix of sensual delights and simmering violence  and the quiet american brings us right into the center of that world 
64508,though lan yu lacks a sense of dramatic urgency  the film makes up for it with a pleasing verisimilitude  
64509,leaving you with some laughs and a smile 
64510,timeless and unique perspective 
64511,it is very difficult to care about the character 
64512,it shows that some studios firmly believe that people have lost the ability to think and will forgive any shoddy product as long as there s a little girlongirl action  
64513,that you ll want to crawl up your own  in embarrassment 
64514,neither the funniest film that eddie murphy nor robert de niro has ever made  showtime is nevertheless efficiently amusing for a good while  
64515,to a small star with big heart 
64516,seen in that light

65666,a fiercely clever and subtle film  capturing the precarious balance between the extravagant confidence of the exiled aristocracy and the cruel earnestness of the victorious revolutionaries 
65667,viewers are asked so often to suspend belief that were it not for holm s performance  the film would be a total washout  
65668,not about scares but a mood in which an ominous  pervasive  and unknown threat lurks just below the proceedings and adds an almost constant mindset of suspense

65681,than anyone could desire to the cheap  graceless  hackneyed scifi serials of the 30s and 40s 
65682, even in all its director s cut glory  he s made a film that s barely shocking  barely interesting and most of all  barely anything 
65683,those underrated professionals who deserve but rarely receive it 
65684,immersed in love  lust  and sin 
65685,too violent and sordid to function as comedy 
65686,for wrapping the theater in a cold blanket of urban desperation 
65687,what saves it  and makes it one of the better videogamebased flicks  is that the film acknowledges upfront that the plot makes no sense  such that the lack of linearity is the point of emotional and moral departure for protagonist alice  
65688,its own cuteness 
65689,it s a very tasteful rock and roll movie  
65690,trying to please his mom 
65691,boarders from venice beach that was a deserved cowinner of the audience award for documentaries at the sundance film festival 
65692,that it s hardly over before it begins to fade from memory

65711,decent tv outing 
65712,a numbingly dull experience 
65713,surprisingly shoddy makeup work 
65714,an engaging and exciting narrative 
65715,it s nice to see piscopo again after all these years  and chaykin and headly are priceless  
65716,to marry science fiction with film noir and action flicks with philosophical inquiry

65729,like a rather unbelievable love interest and a meandering ending  
65730,powerfully evocative 
65731,a sweet  charming tale 
65732,there will be plenty of female audience members drooling over michael idemoto as michael 
65733,to have a good time as it doles out pieces of the famous director s life 
65734,through crap like this 
65735,polanski has found the perfect material with which to address his own world war ii experience in his signature style  
65736,choose the cliffnotes over reading a fulllength classic 
65737,d have to be a most hardhearted person not to be moved by this drama  
65738,you open yourself up to mr reggio s theory of this imagery as the movie s set 
65739,a rustic  realistic  and altogether creepy tale of hidden invasion 
65740,crude humor and vulgar innuendo 
65741,once playful and haunting 
65742,a deft  delightful mix of sulky teen drama and overcomingobstacles sportsmovie triumph

65748,opens today in the new york metropolitan area  so distasteful 
65749, confidently orchestrated  aesthetically and sexually 
65750,s difficult to imagine that a more confused  less interesting and more sloppily made film could possibly come down the road in 2002 
65751,is not really a film as much as it is a loose collection of notsofunny gags  scattered moments of lazy humor 
65752,slightly humorous and tender story 
65753, fat  dumb 
65754, intermittently powerful study 
65755,is too bad that this likable movie is nt more accomplished  
65756,an actor this uncharismatically beautiful 
65757,preposterous 
65758, starving and untalented 
65759,s about as convincing as any other arnie musclefest  but has a little too much resonance with real world events 
65760,take center screen 
65761,this is a stunning film  a oneofakind tour de force  
65762,a soulless jumble of ineptly

65766,abomination 
65767,succeeds as a wellmade evocation of a subculture  
65768,a trifle flat 
65769,it s far from a frothy piece  and the characters are complex  laden with plenty of baggage and tinged with tragic undertones 
65770,of too much kidvid 
65771,if oscar had a category called best bad film you thought was going to be really awful but was nt  guys would probably be duking it out with the queen of the damned for the honor  
65772,it s a hellish  numbing experience to watch  and it does nt offer any insights that have nt been thoroughly debated in the media already  back in the dahmer heyday of the mid  90s

65798,powerful people 
65799,heartening tale 
65800,the emphasis on the latter leaves blue crush waterlogged 
65801,a bonus feature 
65802,the oneliners are snappy

65814,is completely lacking in charm and charisma  and is unable to project either esther s initial anomie or her eventual awakening 
65815,highoctane thriller 
65816,a supremely kittenish performance that gradually accumulates more layers 
65817,bringing an unforced  rapidfire delivery 
65818,that keeps the film grounded in an undeniable social realism 
65819,viewing for civics classes and wouldbe public servants alike 
65820,it would be great to see this turd squashed under a truck  preferably a semi  
65821,there s a sheer unbridled delight in the way

65823, the picture begins to resemble the shapeless  grasping actors  workshop that it is  
65824,extravagantly 
65825,so beautifully acted and directed  it s clear that washington most certainly has a new career ahead of him if he so chooses  
65826,compelling look 
65827,the film is wellcrafted and this one is 
65828,disappointment 
65829,good chance 
65830,steals so freely from other movies 
65831,made me want to bolt the theater in the first 10 minutes 
65832,it no longer recognizes the needs of moviegoers for real characters and compelling plots 
65833,into a typical romantic triangle 
65834,one as brave and challenging as you could possibly expect these days from american cinema 
65835,those with a modicum of patience will find in these characters  foibles a timeless and unique perspective  
65836,little melodramatic

65925,mind crappy movies as much as adults 
65926,their computeranimated faces are very expressive  
65927,to perform entertaining tricks 
65928,i am more offended by his lack of faith in his audience than by anything on display here  
65929,a provocative piece 
65930,as good  if not 
65931,a complete wash 
65932,the actors make this worth a peek  
65933,has a bloated plot that stretches the running time about 10 minutes 
65934,a war tribute is disgusting to begin with 
65935,its own making 
65936,sit through a crummy  wannabehip crime comedy that refers incessantly to old movies  when you could just rent those movies instead  let alone seek out a respectable new one 
65937,politically potent 
65938,it s a rather listless amble down the middle of the road  where the thematic ironies are too obvious and the sexual politics too smug  
65939,does a convincing impersonation here of a director enjoying himself immensely 
65940,delivers more goodies than lumps of coal 
65941,emphasizes the wellwrought story and 
65942,marked an emerging indian american cinema 
65943,lacks 
65944,gooding and coburn are both oscar winners  a fact which  as you watch them clumsily mugging their way through snow dogs  seems inconceivable  
65945,family  forgiveness and love 
65946,labored 
65947,touching  
65948,even through its flaws  revolution  9 proves to be a compelling 
65949,sucked dry the undead action flick formula 
65950,my wife is an actress works as well as it does because  the leads  are such a companionable couple  
65951,more measured or polished production 
65952,makes 98 minutes feel like three hours  
65953,that ca nt totally hide its contrivances 
65954,supersimple animation 
65955,tosca s intoxicating ardor 
65956,next week  why bother with a contemptible imitator starring a  snl  hasbeen acting like an 8yearold channeling roberto benigni  
65957,a verbal duel 
65958,and cinematic deception 
65959,of being a bit undisciplined 
65960,point the way for adventurous indian filmmakers toward a crossover 
65961,wildly overproduced 
65962,note that this film  like the similarly illtimed antitrust  is easily as bad at a fraction the budget 
65963,in undergraduate doubling subtexts and ridiculous stabs 
65964,the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy 
65965,is even more ludicrous than you d expect from the guyinadress genre 
65966,as rogue cia assassins working for chris cooper s agency boss close in on the resourceful amnesiac 
65967,a good line in charm 
65968,such a companionable couple 
65969,relentlessly nasty 
65970,95 minutes 
65971,quirkily appealing 
65972,elegant and sly deadpan 
65973, gentle  
65974,will find millions of eager fans 
65975,may be relieved that his latest feature  r xmas  marks a modest if encouraging return to form  
65976,quickly sinks into bythenumbers territory  
65977,is an uncompromising film 
65978,is like reading a research paper  
65979,offers a desperately ingratiating performance  
65980,strokes the eyeballs while it evaporates like so much crypt mist in the brain 
65981,why  for instance  good things happen to bad people 
65982,despicable 
65983,open windows 
65984,value can not be denied 
65985,represents an engaging and intimate first feature by a talented director to watch 
65986,wellacted  welldirected and  for all its moodiness  not too pretentious  
65987,overly long 
65988,would subtlety be lost on the target audience 
65989,a gently funny  sweetly adventurous film that makes you feel genuinely good 
65990,smart  compelling 
65991,this is one of those rare pictures that you root for throughout 
65992,is nicholson s goofy  heartfelt  mesmerizing king lear 
65993,world traveler gave me no reason to care 
65994,proves to be a compelling 
65995,felt  not the craven of  a nightmare on elm street  or  the hills have eyes   but the sad schlock merchant of  deadly friend 
65996,terrific screenplay 
65997,what a stiflingly unfunny and unoriginal mess this is  
65998,more ambitious 
65999,seems worth the effort 
66000,it does turn out to be a bit of a cheat in the end 
66001,may be convinced that he has something significant to say 
66002,to be both hugely entertaining and uplifting  
66003, boredom never takes hold  
66004,left to work with  sort of like michael jackson s nose 
66005,exhilarating 
66006,formula mercilessly 
66007,great story 
66008,is constructed around a core of flimsy  or  worse yet  nonexistent  ideas 
66009,of faith in the future 
66010,movie gauge 
66011,gloriously 
66012,exploitative and largely devoid of the depth or sophistication that would make watching such a graphic treatment of the crimes bearable  
66013,providing comic relief 
66014,gentle and engrossing character 
66015,whine  the bellyaching of a paranoid and unlikable man 
66016,this is nt a movie  
66017,does nt quite do justice to the awfulness of the movie  for that comes through all too painfully in the execution  
66018,an undeniable entertainment value 
66019,invokes the percussion rhythm  the brass soul and the sense of fierce competition that helps make great marching bands half the fun of college football games 
66020,is a movie that puts itself squarely in the service of the lovers who inhabit it  
66021,about something is an amicable endeavor  
66022,an excellent sequel  
66023,funny  sexy  devastating and incurably romantic 
66024,impressively discreet filmmakers 
66025,s never been better in this colorful biopic of a mexican icon 
66026,the production design  score and choreography are simply intoxicating  
66027,provides 
66028,insight and humor 
66029,has that rare quality of being able to creep the living hell out of you  
66030,achieves its emotional power and moments of revelation 
66031,this film s impressive performances and 
66032,futile concoction 
66033,begins with promise  but runs aground after being snared in its own tangled plot  
66034,the slapstick is labored  and 
66035,infantile 
66036,raunchy and frequently hilarious followup 
66037,even a plot 
66038,avoid seeing this trite  predictable rehash 
66039,feel realistic 
66040,weirdness for the sake of weirdness 
66041,unexpected moments of authentically impulsive humor 
66042,what a bewilderingly brilliant and entertaining movie this is  
66043,sags 
66044,we do nt even like their characters  
66045,interesting characters or even a halfway intriguing plot 
66046,could nt find stardom if mapquest emailed him pointtopoint driving directions 
66047,fans will undoubtedly enjoy it  
66048,is  a fascinating character  and deserves a better vehicle than this facetious smirk of a movie 
66049,the most ravaging  
66050,it wo nt hold up over the long haul 
66051,have at it 
66052,seamless 
66053,of boring talking heads  etc  
66054,reinvents himself 
66055,a predictably efficient piece of business notable largely for its overwhelming creepiness  for an eagerness to create images you wish you had nt seen  which  in this day and age  is of course the point 
66056,occasionally loud and offensive  but more often 
66057,the town has kind of an authentic feel  but each one of these people stand out and everybody else is in the background and it just seems manufactured to me and artificial  
66058,its sincere acting 
66059,this feature is about as necessary as a hole in the head 
66060,well  it probably wo nt have you swinging from the trees hooting it s praises  but 
66061,an unsettling  memorable cinematic experience that 
66062,balances both traditional or modern stories together in a manner 
66063,does nt even seem like she tried 
66064,the attraction between these two marginal characters is complex from the start  and  refreshingly  stays that way  
66065,the impressive stagings of hardware 
66066,that even slightly wisedup kids would quickly change the channel 
66067,his sense of story and his juvenile camera movements smack of a film school undergrad 
66068,it s just grating 
66069,stimulating 
66070,sade achieves the nearimpossible  it turns the marquis de sade into a dullard  
66071,did just that and it s what makes their project so interesting 
66072,unusual but unfortunately also irritating 
66073,two hours better watching 
66074,tiresome rant 
66075,is a sincerely crafted picture that deserves to emerge from the traffic jam of holiday movies  
66076,such a clever adaptation of the bard s tragic play 
66077,creative act 
66078,hoping it will be  and in that sense is a movie that deserves recommendation 
66079,check this one out 
66080,sparkling 
66081,are based on stock clichés 
66082,never so vividly 
66083,i like all four of the lead actors a lot and they manage to squeeze a few laughs out of the material  but they re treading water at best in this forgettable effort  
66084,standup magic 
66085,a solid  psychological action film from hong kong 
66086,the  saving private ryan  battle scenes 
66087,create a feature film that is wickedly fun to watch 
66088,goosepimple 
66089,to see what all the fuss is about 
66090, the new film is a subzero version of monsters  inc  without the latter s imagination  visual charm or texture  
66091,some savvy street activism 
66092,that s still too burdened by the actor 
66093, she s appealingly manic and energetic  
66094,urge to doze 
66095,also nicely done 
66096,a pretty decent little documentary 
66097,temperamental 
66098,is dark  brooding and slow  
66099,rice never clearly defines his characters or gives us a reason to care about them  
66100,an intricate plot 
66101,much of jonah simply  and gratefully 
66102,humor and technological finish 
66103,so lovely toward the end 
66104,all mood and no movie  
66105,give it a boost 
66106,if the predictability of bland comfort food appeals to you 
66107,fairly solid  not to mention well edited so that it certainly does nt feel like a film that strays past the two and a half mark 
66108,is one of the year s best films  
66109,who are capable of anteing up some movie star charisma when they need it to sell us on this twisted love story  but who can also negotiate the movie s darker turns 
66110,stepped into the mainstream of filmmaking with an assurance worthy of international acclaim 
66111,entirely humorless 
66112,has never been filmed more irresistibly than in  baran  
66113,intellectual and 
66114,engaging  imaginative filmmaking in its nearly 2 12 
66115,bloated effects 
66116,its makebelieve promise of life that soars above the material realm 
66117,made a point or two regarding life 
66118,by anything on display 
66119,is entirely appealing as pumpkin 
66120,a compelling  gutclutching piece of advocacy cinema that carries you along in a torrent of emotion as it explores the awful complications of one terrifying day  
66121,this odd  poetic road movie  
66122,also wanted a little alien as a friend  
66123,sets the tone for a summer of good stuff 
66124,with yet another remarkable yet shockingly littleknown perspective 
66125,tries too hard to be funny in a way that s too loud  too goofy and too short of an attention span  
66126,try to guess the order in which the kids in the house will be gored 
66127,at the end that extravagantly redeems it 
66128,makes an amazing breakthrough in her first starring role and 
66129,snagged an oscar nomination 
66130,to embody the worst excesses of nouvelle vague without any of its sense of fun or energy 
66131,decided to let crocodile hunter steve irwin do what he does best  and fashion a story around him 
66132,par with the first one 
66133,coos beseechingly at you 
66134,the hot chick is pretty damned funny  
66135,approaches swedish fatalism using gary larson s far side humor 
66136,marred 
66137,the bottom line  at least in my opinion  is imposter makes a better short story than it does a film  
66138,fringe feminist conspiracy theorist 
66139, meandering  and sometimes dry 
66140,few good ideas 
66141,a hokey piece of nonsense that tries too hard to be emotional  
66142,engages us in constant fits of laughter  until we find ourselves surprised at how much we care about the story  and end up walking out not only satisfied but also somewhat touched 
66143,inspiring  ironic  and 
66144,is astonishing  
66145, bile  and irony 
66146,have put together a bold biographical fantasia 
66147,despite some strong performances  never rises above the level of a telanovela  
66148,s cliche to call the film  refreshing 
66149,weak 
66150,of the best  most 
66151,the kneejerk misogyny that passes for humor in so many teenage comedies 
66152,misleading 
66153,made literature literal without killing its soul  a feat any thinking person is bound to appreciate 
66154,is  the comedy equivalent of saddam hussein 
66155,the lives of women torn apart by a legacy of abuse 
66156,is creepy in a michael jackson sort of way 
66157,new age 
66158,intelligence and a vision both painterly and literary 
66159, it would gobble in dolby digital stereo  
66160,squirming 
66161,a great piece 
66162,is hampered by its predictable plot and paperthin supporting characters  
66163,why not invite some genuine spontaneity into the film by having the evil aliens  laser guns actually hit something for once  
66164,quirky  charming 
66165,the good  which is its essential problem 
66166,forgotten everything he ever knew about generating suspense 
66167,is a beautiful film to watch 
66168,noyce s greatest mistake 
66169,feelgood family comedy 
66170,you love the music  and i do 
66171,a monster 
66172,ensures 
66173,a level of young  black manhood that is funny  touching  smart and complicated 
66174,a thoughtful and surprisingly affecting portrait of a screwedup man who dared to mess with some powerful people 
66175,are more interesting ways of dealing with the subject 
66176,is particularly impressive 
66177,has enough moments to keep it entertaining 
66178,from an adventurous young talent who finds his inspiration on the fringes of the american underground 
66179,stylish exercise 
66180,is a must for genre fans 
66181,enthusiastic 
66182,timelessness 
66183,that you feel what they feel 
66184,worth seeing just for weaver and lapaglia 
66185,nightmarish 
66186,a bit melodramatic and even a little dated 
66187,wearing the somewhat cumbersome 3d goggles 
66188,the charisma of hugh grant and sandra bullock 
66189,barbershop is tuned in to its community  
66190,owed to benigni 
66191,rated eee for excitement 
66192,its agenda to deliver aweinspiring  at times sublime  visuals 
66193,muddy sound 
66194,manages to be compelling  amusing and unsettling at the same time 
66195,as compelling 
66196,is deceptively simple  deeply satisfying 
66197,predictable at every turn 
66198,volatile 
66199,comes with the laziness and arrogance of a thing that already knows it s won 
66200, great to look at  and funny 
66201,the longest 90 minutes of your moviegoing life 
66202,dead  water  weight 
66203,finds its tone and several scenes run 
66204,re gon na like this movie 
66205, tedious 
66206,kung pow seems like some futile concoction that was developed hastily after oedekerk 
66207,attractive throughout 
66208,would have a hard time sitting through this one  
66209,the rarest kinds of films 
66210,listen to extremist namecalling 
66211, painful improbability 
66212,accomplishes 
66213,are beautifully realized through clever makeup design  leaving one to hope that the eventual dvd release will offer subtitles and the original italianlanguage soundtrack 
66214,ultimately  the film never recovers from the clumsy cliché of the ugly american abroad  and the toofrosty exterior ms paltrow employs to authenticate her british persona is another liability  
66215,that s as freshfaced as its youngguns cast 
66216,strong itch to explore more 
66217,perpetually wasted 
66218,an intense experience 
66219,feeling this movie until it veered off too far into the exxon zone  and left me behind at the station looking for a return ticket to realism 
66220,that plays like some weird masterpiece theater sketch with neither 
66221, so  hopefully  this film will attach a human face to all those little steaming cartons  
66222,a mustsee 
66223,make you feel that you never want to see another car chase  explosion or gunfight again 
66224,breaks your heart 
66225,ick  
66226,very original 
66227,as giddy and whimsical and relevant today 
66228,there is a certain sense of experimentation and improvisation to this film that may not always work  but it is nevertheless compelling 
66229,so hilarious 
66230,an undeniably moving film 
66231,compelling  amusing and unsettling 
66232,the holes in this film remain agape  holes punched through by an inconsistent  meandering  and sometimes dry plot  
66233,not easily and  in the end  not well enough 
66234,a different and emotionally reserved type of survival story  a film less about refracting all of world war ii through the specific conditions of one man  and more about that man 
66235,that will enthrall the whole family 
66236,awful 
66237,stereotypical familial quandaries 
66238,in a heartwarming  nonjudgmental kind of way  
66239,enjoy the perfectly pitched web of tension that chabrol spins 
66240,supporting 
66241,excite 
66242,both garcia and jagger turn in perfectly executed and wonderfully sympathetic characters  who are alternately touching and funny  
66243,of the lowgrade cheese standards on which it operates 
66244,to find better entertainment 
66245,the energetic and always surprising performance 
66246,brady 
66247,good laughs 
66248,aloof and 
66249,is careless and unfocused 
66250,s brilliant  videodrome 
66251,to do  too little time to do it in 
66252,a pretty decent kidpleasing  tolerabletoadults lark of a movie 
66253,with revulsion 
66254,the film gets added disdain for the fact that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand  
66255,enough to feel good about 
66256,antifeminist 
66257,that has something to say 
66258,enjoy as mild escapism 
66259,tsai has a welldeserved reputation as one of the cinema world s great visual stylists  and 
66260,dull

66271,it does nt make for great cinema

66276,final whistle 
66277,do nt think this movie loves women at all 
66278,through the horrible pains of a death 
66279,work as a jaunt down memory lane for teens and young adults who grew up on televised scoobydoo shows or reruns 
66280,but film buffs should get to know 
66281,a journey that is as difficult for the audience to take as it is for the protagonist 
66282,it s a pleasure to have a film like the hours as an alternative  
66283,can not help be entertained by the sight of someone getting away with something 
66284,even the hastily and amateurishly drawn animation can not engage  
66285,problem is  we have no idea what in creation is going on  
66286,so exaggerated and broad that it comes off as annoying rather than charming  
66287,those farts got to my inner nineyearold 
66288,it s an odd show  pregnant with moods  stillborn except as a harsh conceptual exercise  
66289,messenger 
66290,illogic 
66291,starts slowly  but adrien brody  in the title role  helps make the film s conclusion powerful and satisfying

66299,it s goofy  if not entirely wholesome  fun 
66300,magical enough

66309,bullock and grant still look ill at ease sharing the same scene  
66310,an exceptional thriller

66312,a good ear for dialogue  
66313,s the gift of the magi relocated to the scuzzy underbelly of nyc s drug scene  
66314,is predictable 
66315,who could too easily become comic relief in any other film  
66316,mawkish dialogue 
66317,it s at once laughable and compulsively watchable  in its committed dumbness  
66318,it s a very sincere work  but it would be better as a diary or documentary

66635,radiant 
66636,the script has less spice than a rat burger and the rock s fighting skills are more in line with steven seagal

66638,marvelously entertaining 
66639,saw that was written down 
66640,depressingly thin and exhaustingly contrived  
66641,the film s considered approach to its subject matter is too calm and thoughtful for agitprop  and the thinness of its characterizations makes it a failure as straight drama   
66642,better to do with 94 minutes

66818,the new insomnia is a surprisingly faithful remake of its chilly predecessor  and when it does elect to head off in its own direction  it employs changes that fit it well rather than ones that were imposed for the sake of commercial sensibilities  
66819,some real vitality and 
66820,drops the ball too many times 
66821,both heartbreaking and 
66822,indeed  the first half of sorority boys is as appalling as any  comedy  to ever spill from a projector s lens

66867,the problematic characters and overly convenient plot twists foul up shum s good intentions  
66868,for a movie about the power of poetry and passion  there is precious little of either  
66869,the plot is nothing but boilerplate clichés from start to finish  and the script assumes that not only would subtlety be lost on the target audience  but that it s also too stupid to realize that they ve already seen this exact same movie a hundred times 
66870,the most watchable film of the year 
66871,aboveaverage brains

67147,nicks refuses to let slackers be seen as just another teen movie  which means he can be forgiven for frequently pandering to fans of the grossout comedy  
67148,all the values of a straighttovideo movie 
67149,well edited so that it certainly does nt feel like a film that strays past the two and a half mark 
67150,jealousy  betrayal  forgiveness and murder 
67151,laughoutloud 
67152,a provocative 
67153,it weirdly appealing 
67154,verging on mumbojumbo 
67155,form at once visceral and spiritual  wonderfully vulgar and sublimely lofty  and as emotionally grand as life 
67156,sewing together what could have been a confusing and horrifying vision into an intense and engrossing headtrip 
67157,what is missing from it 
67158,plotting 
67159,has a film used manhattan s architecture in such a gloriously goofy way  
67160,that worked five years ago but has since lost its fizz 
67161,prove that moviestar intensity can overcome bad hair design 
67162,of crudup s anchoring performance 
67163,one that allows him to churn out one mediocre movie after another 
67164,goofiness 
67165,but mainstream audiences will find little of interest in this film  which is often preachy and poorly acted  
67166,the second half of the movie really goes downhill  
67167,moving and solidly entertaining 
67168,it still comes off as a touching  transcendent love story  
67169,that never quite equals the sum of its pretensions  
67170,is well crafted  and well executed  
67171,resurrection 
67172,different from others in its genre in that it is does not rely on dumb gags  anatomical humor  or character cliches 
67173,decided to let crocodile hunter steve irwin do what he does best  and fashion a story around him  
67174,after another  most of which involve precocious kids getting the better of obnoxious adults 
67175,the best  
67176,involving the various silbersteins that it feels more like the pilot episode of a tv series than a feature film 
67177,all of dean s mannerisms and selfindulgence  
67178,found in almost all of his previous works 
67179,truly excellent 
67180,director to watch 
67181,sharp and quick 
67182,orgy 
67183,warm your heart without making you feel guilty about it 
67184,the magnificent jackie chan 
67185,collapses 
67186, vapid and devoid 
67187,by a plot that s just too boring and obvious 
67188,complain 
67189,winning performances 
67190,its love of life and beauty 
67191,soulless and  even more damning  
67192,cold fish

67200,discomfort 
67201,you never want to see another car chase  explosion or gunfight again 
67202,totally overwrought  
67203,sunny disposition 
67204,excellent use of music by india s popular gulzar and jagjit singh

67206,awfulness 
67207,ably captures the complicated relationships in a marching band  
67208,lax and limp 
67209,wisdom 
67210,a paintbynumbers picture 
67211,does a solid job of slowly  steadily building up to the climactic burst of violence 
67212,through this summer that do not involve a dentist drill 
67213,i heard a mysterious voice  and felt myself powerfully drawn toward the light  the light of the exit sign 
67214,nights feels more like a quickie tv special than a feature film  
67215,is a winning comedy that excites the imagination and tickles the funny bone 
67216,is so resolutely 
67217,hilariously  gloriously alive  and 
67218,drawnout 
67219,true to its title 
67220,glory days 
67221,and often contradictory 
67222,a stereotype 
67223,puts a human face 
67224,every moment crackles with tension  and by the end of the flick  you re on the edge of your seat 
67225, then by all means check it out  
67226,while parker and cowriter catherine di napoli are faithful to melville s plotline  they and a fully engaged supporting cast  have made the old boy s characters more quickwitted than any english lit 
67227,sorvino makes the princess seem smug and cartoonish  and the film only really comes alive when poor hermocrates and leontine pathetically compare notes about their budding amours  
67228,too thin 
67229,sitting in a downtown café  overhearing a bunch of typical latetwentysomethings natter on about nothing  and 
67230,wondering what all that jazz was about  chicago  in 2002 
67231,as a tribute 
67232,a brilliant college student  where s pauly shore as the rocket scientist  
67233,of the conflict that came to define a generation 
67234,richly entertaining and suggestive of any number of metaphorical readings  
67235,will be moved to the edge of their seats by the dynamic first act 
67236,bump in the night and nobody 
67237,has created a provocative  absorbing drama that reveals the curse of a selfhatred instilled by rigid social mores  
67238,this painfully unfunny farce traffics in tired stereotypes and encumbers itself with complications  
67239, the movie contains no wit  only labored gags  
67240,that are quite touching 
67241,i liked about schmidt a lot  but i have a feeling that i would have liked it much more if harry  tonto never existed  
67242,graceless 
67243,that annoying specimen 
67244,two central performances 
67245, hanging over the film 
67246,it takes a sudden turn and devolves into a bizarre sort of romantic comedy 
67247,are all in the performances  from foreman s barkingmad taylor to thewlis s smoothly sinister freddie and bettanymcdowell s hardeyed gangster  
67248,affluence 
67249,really  save your disgust and your indifference 
67250,five screenwriters are credited with the clichéladen screenplay 
67251,joyous 
67252,gets us too drunk on the party favors to sober us up with the transparent attempts at moralizing  
67253,then blood work is for you  
67254, frida gets the job done  
67255,the class warfare 
67256,against shimmering cinematography that lends the setting the ethereal beauty of an asian landscape painting 
67257,a transparently hypocritical work that feels as though it s trying to set the women s liberation movement back 20 years 
67258,may rate as the most magical and most fun family fare of this or any recent holiday season 
67259,their contrast is neither dramatic nor comic  it s just a weird fizzle  
67260,lacks in eyepopping visuals 
67261,ability to pull together easily accessible stories that resonate with profundity 
67262,an equally miserable film 
67263,its heartfelt concern about north korea s recent past and south korea s future 
67264,so pat it makes your teeth hurt 
67265,a delightful entree in the tradition of food movies  
67266,splash 
67267,of gags that rely on the strength of their own cleverness 
67268,both the scenic splendor 
67269,i saw it as a young boy 
67270,wildly incompetent but brilliantly named half past dead  or for seagal pessimists  
67271,you may be captivated  as i was  by its moods  and by its subtly transformed star  and still wonder why paul thomas anderson ever had the inclination to make the most sincere and artful movie in which adam sandler will probably ever appear  
67272,a chilling tale of one of the great crimes 
67273,starts out 
67274,the situation in a wellbalanced fashion 
67275,which was shot two years ago 
67276,becomes something about how lame it is to try and evade your responsibilities 
67277,will keep coming 
67278,you d be hard put to find a movie character more unattractive or odorous  than leon   
67279,proves that director m night shyamalan can weave an eerie spell and that mel gibson can gasp  shudder and even tremble without losing his machismo  
67280,where this was lazy but enjoyable  a formula comedy redeemed by its stars  that is even lazier and far less enjoyable  
67281,a total lack 
67282,a hallmark film in an increasingly important film industry and worth the look 
67283,the company s astonishing growth 
67284,of afghan tragedies 
67285,languorous slomo sequences 
67286,s characteristically startling visual style and an almost palpable sense of intensity  
67287,is a masterpiece of elegant wit and artifice  
67288,offers a guiltfree trip into feelgood territory  
67289,pictureperfect life 
67290,master class  
67291,juniorhigh 
67292,finds amusing juxtapositions that justify his exercise  
67293,rigid and evasive in ways 
67294,billy crystal and robert de niro sleepwalk through vulgarities in a sequel you can refuse  
67295,a finelooking film with a bouncy score 
67296,promisingly 
67297,the entire movie is in need of a scented bath  
67298,weirdo actor crispin glover 
67299,takes its title all too literally  
67300,is loopy and ludicrous  
67301,threatens 
67302,there  done that 
67303,who s finally been given a part worthy of her considerable talents 
67304,what makes the movie special 
67305,the action looks fake 
67306,blood work is laughable in the solemnity with which it tries to pump life into overworked elements from eastwood s dirty harry period  
67307,maintaining consciousness just long enough 
67308,difficult to feel anything much while watching this movie  beyond mild disturbance or detached pleasure at the acting 
67309,is so fascinating that you wo nt care  
67310,watching this gentle  mesmerizing portrait of a man coming to terms with time  you barely realize your mind is being blown  
67311,does justice both to stevenson and to the scifi genre 
67312,a better movie 
67313,monotone 
67314,faced with the possibility that her life is meaningless  vapid and devoid of substance  in a movie that is definitely meaningless  vapid and devoid of substance 
67315,s always enthralling  
67316, another grossout college comedy  ugh  
67317,affirms 
67318,gets added disdain for the fact that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand  
67319,formuliac  but fun  
67320,a quietly moving look back at what it was to be iranianamerican in 1979  
67321,to hit theaters since beauty and the beast 11 years ago 
67322,welldone 
67323,fighting games  wire fu  horror movies  mystery  james bond  wrestling  scifi and anime into one big bloody stew 
67324,dialogue and likeable characters 
67325,part biography  part entertainment and part history 
67326, the film s midtolow budget is betrayed by the surprisingly shoddy makeup work  
67327,a rather dull  unimaginative car chase 
67328,is nothing short of a great one  
67329,a supremely hopeful cautionary tale of war s madness remembered that we  today  can prevent its tragic waste of life 
67330,is so bad that i even caught the gum stuck under my seat trying to sneak out of the theater 
67331,90plus years taking the effort to share his impressions of life and loss and time and art with us 
67332,confuses its message with an ultimate desire to please  and contorting itself into an idea of expectation 
67333,comedy ensemble 
67334,throws quirky characters  odd situations  and offkilter dialogue at us  all as if to say   look at this  
67335,brilliant movie 
67336,too interested in jerking off in all its byzantine incarnations to bother pleasuring its audience 
67337,s stuffy and pretentious 
67338,polished  
67339,works more often than it does nt  
67340,at least passably 
67341,i also believe that resident evil is not it  
67342,seem to be in a contest to see who can outbadact the other 
67343,showing off his doctorate 
67344,a delightful comedy 
67345,anguish  anger and frustration 
67346,at achieving the modest  crowdpleasing goals it sets for itself 
67347,a patient viewer 
67348,this new jangle of noise  mayhem and stupidity must be a serious contender for the title
